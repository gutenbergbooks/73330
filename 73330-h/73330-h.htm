<p class="drop-cap">SUN and wind of thirty-six out-of-door
years had tanned Mr. Jeff Bransford’s
cheek to a rosy-brown, contrasting sharply
with the whiteness of the upper part of his
forehead, when exposed—as now—by the
pushing up of his sombrero. These same
suns and winds had drawn at the corners of
his eyes a network of fine lines: but the brown
eyes were undimmed, and his face had a light,
sure look of unquenchable boyishness; sure
mark of the unattached, and therefore carefree
and irresponsible man, who, as the saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
goes, “is at home wherever his hat is
hung.”</p>

<p>The hat in question was a soft gray one,
the crown deeply creased down the middle,
the wide brim of it joyously atilt, merging
insensibly from one wavy curve into another
and on to yet a third, like Hogarth’s line of
beauty.</p>

<p>Mr. Bransford’s step was alert and
springy: perhaps it had even a slight, unconscious
approach to a swagger, as of one
not unsatisfied with himself. He turned at
the corner of Temple Street, skipped lightsome
up a stairway and opened an office
door, bearing on its glass front the inscription:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large">SIMON HIBLER</span><br>
<br>
ATTORNEY-AT-LAW</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Hibler in?”</p>

<p>The only occupant of the room—a smooth-faced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> 
and frank-eyed young man—rose from
his desk and came forward.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hibler is not in town.”</p>

<p>“Dee-lightful! And when will he be
back?” The rising inflection on the last word
conveyed a resolute vivacity proof against
small annoyances.</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, I do not know.
He is over in Arizona, near San Simon—for
change and rest.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” The tip of the visitor’s nose
twitched slightly, the brown eyes widened reflectively;
the capable mouth under the brown
mustache puckered as if to emit a gentle
whistle. “He’ll bring back the change. I’ll
take all bets on that. San Simon! H’m!”
He shrugged his shoulders, one corner of his
mouth pulled down in whimsical fashion,
while the opposite eyebrow arched, so giving
his face an appearance indescribably odd: the
drooping side expressive of profound melancholy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
while the rest of his face retained its
habitual look of invincible cheerfulness. “San
Simon! Dear, oh dear! And I may just
nicely contemplate my two thumbs till he gets
back with the change—and maybeso the
rest!” He elevated the thumbs and cast
vigilant glances at each in turn: half-chanting,
dreamily:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent">“‘O, she left her Tombstone home</div>
<div class="indent2">For to dwell in San Simon,</div>
<div class="verse">And she run off with a prairie-navigator.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>—Ran off, I should say.” His nose tweaked
again.</p>

<p>The clerk was a newcomer in El Paso,
hardly yet wonted to the freakish humor and
high spirits that there flourish unrebuked—and
indeed, unnoticed. But he entered into
the spirit of the occasion. “Is there anything
I can do?” he inquired. “I am Mr.
Hibler’s chief—and only—clerk.”</p>

<p>“No-o,” said the visitor doubtfully, letting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
his eyes wander from his thumbs to the
view of white-walled Juarez beyond the
river. “No-o—That is, not unless you can
sell me his Rainbow ranch and brand for less
than they’re worth. Such is my errand—on
behalf of Pringle, Beebe, Ballinger and
Bransford. I’m Bransford—me.”</p>

<p>“Jeff Bransford? Mr. Hibler’s foreman?”
asked the young man eagerly.</p>

<p>“<i>Mr.</i> Jeff Bransford—foreman <i>for</i> Hibler—not
of,” amended Bransford gently.
His thumbs were still upreared. Becoming
suddenly aware of this, he fixed them with a
startled gaze.</p>

<p>“Say! Take supper with me!” The
young man blurted out the words. “Mr.
Hibler’s always talking about you and I want
to get acquainted with you. Aughinbaugh’s
my name.”</p>

<p>Bransford sat down heavily, thumbs still
erect, elbows well out from his side, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
transferred his gaze, with marked respect, to
the clerk’s boyish face, now very rosy indeed.</p>

<p>Jeff’s eyes grew big and round; his lips
were slightly parted; the thumbs drooped, the
fingers spread wide apart in mutual dismay.
Holding Aughinbaugh’s eyes with his own,
he pressed one outspread hand over his heart.
Slowly, cautiously, the other hand fumbled
in a vest pocket, produced notebook and pencil,
spread the book stealthily on his knee
and began to write. “‘A good name,’” he
murmured, “‘is rather to be chosen than
great riches.’”</p>

<p>But the owner of the good name was a lad
of spirit, and had no mind to submit tamely
to such hazing. “See here! What does a
cowboy know about the Bible, anyway?” he
demanded, glaring indignantly. “I believe
you’re a sheep in wolves’ clothing! You don’t
talk like a cowboy—or look like a cowboy.”</p>

<p>Jeff glanced down at his writing, and back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
to his questioner. Then he made an alteration,
closed the book and looked up again.
He had a merry eye.</p>

<p>“Exactly how does a cowboy look? And
how does it talk?” he asked mildly. He
glanced with much interest over as much of
his own person as he could see; turning and
twisting to aid the process. “I don’t see anything
wrong. Is my hair on straight?”</p>

<p>“Wrong!” echoed Aughinbaugh severely,
shaking an accusing finger. “Why, you’re
all wrong. What the public expects——”</p>

<p>Mr. Bransford’s interruption may be
omitted. It was profane. Also, it was
plagiarized from Commodore Vanderbilt.</p>

<p>“You a cowboy! Yah!” said Aughinbaugh
in vigorous scorn. “With a silk necktie!
Everybody knows that the typical cowboy
wears a red cotton handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“How long since you left New York?”</p>

<p>“Me? I’m from Kansas City.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“Same thing,” said Bransford coldly. “I
mean, how long since you came to El Paso?
And have you been out of town since?”</p>

<p>“About eight months. And I confess that
my duties—at first in the bank and afterwards
here, have kept me pretty close, except for
a trip or two to Juarez. But why?”</p>

<p>“Why enough!” returned Jeff. “Young
man, young man! I see the finger of fate
in this. It is no blind chance that brought
me here while Hibler was away. It was predestined
from the foundations of earth that
I was to come here at this very now to explain
to you about cowboys. I have the concentrated
venom of about twenty-one years
stored away to work off on somebody, and
I feel it in my bones that you are the man.
Come with me and I will do you good—as
it says in mournful Numbers. You’ve been
led astray. You shouldn’t believe all you read
and only half what you see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“In the first place, take the typical cowboy.
There positively ain’t no sich person!
Maybe so half of ’em’s from Texas and the
other half from anywhere and everywhere
else. But they’re all alike in just one thing—and
that is that every last one of them is
entirely different from all the others. Each
one talks as he pleases, acts as he pleases and—when
not at work—dresses as he pleases.
On the range though, they all dress pretty
much alike.—Because, the things they wear
there have been tried out and they’ve kept
only the best of each kind—the best for that
particular kind of work.”</p>

<p>“They ‘proved all things and held fast
that which was good,’” suggested Aughinbaugh.</p>

<p>“Exactly. For instance, that handkerchief
business. That isn’t meant as a substitute
for a necktie. Ever see a drought? If
you did, you probably remember that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
some dusty. Well—there’s been a steady
drought out here for two hundred and eight
million years come August. And when you
drive two, three thousand head of cattle, with
four feet apiece, to the round-up ground and
chouse ’em ’round half a day, cutting out
steers, the dust is so thick a horse can’t fall
down when he stumbles. Then mister cowboy
folds his little hankie, like them other
triangles that the ladies, God bless ’em, with
their usual perversity, call ‘squares,’ ties the
ends, puts the knot at the back of his neck,
pulls the wide part <i>over</i> his mouth and up
over the bridge of his nose, <i>and breathes
through it</i>! Got that? By heavens, it’s a
filter to keep the dust out of your lungs, and
not an ornament! It’s usually silk—not because
silk is booful but because it’s better to
breathe through.”</p>

<p>“Really, I never dreamed——” began
Aughinbaugh. But Jeff waved him down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“Don’t speak to the man at the wheel, my
son. And everything a cowboy uses, at work,
from hat to boots, from saddle to bed, has
just as good a reason for being exactly what
it is as that handkerchief. Take the high-heeled
boots, now——”</p>

<p>“Dad,” said Aughinbaugh firmly. “I am
faint. Break it to me easy. I was once an
interior decorator of some promise, though
not a professional. Let me lead you to a
restaurant and show you a sample of my
skill. Then come round to my rooms and
tell me your troubles at leisure. Maybe
you’ll feel better. But before you explain
your wardrobe I want to know why you
don’t say ‘You all’ and ‘that-a-way,’
‘plumb’ and ‘done gone,’ and the rest of
it.”</p>

<p>“I do, my dear, when I want to,” said
Bransford affectionately. “Them’s all useful
words, easy and comfortable, like old clothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
and old shoes. I like ’em. But they go with
the old clothes. And now, as you see, I am—to
use the metropolitan idiom—in my ‘glad
rags’ and my speech naturally rises in dignity
to meet the occasion. Besides, associating
with Beebe—he’s one of them siss—boom—ah!
boys—has mitigated me a heap. Then
I read the signs, and the brands on the freight
cars. And I’ll tell you one more thing, my
son. A large proportion—I mean, of course,
a right smart chance—of the cowboys are
illiterate, and some of them are grand rascals,
but they ain’t none of ’em plumb imbeciles.
They couldn’t stay on the job. If
their brains don’t naturally work pretty spry,
things happen to ’em—the chuck-wagon bunts
’em or something. And they all have a
chance at ‘the education of a gentleman’—‘to
ride, to shoot and to speak the truth.’
They have to ride and shoot—and speakin’
the truth comes easier for them than for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
folks, ’cause if speaking the aforesaid truth
displeases any one they mostly don’t give a
damn.”</p>

<p>“Stop! Spare me!” cried Aughinbaugh.
He collapsed in his chair, sliding together in
an attitude of extreme dejection. “My spirits
are very low, but——” He rose, tottered
feebly to his desk and took therefrom a small
bottle, which, with a glass, he handed to
Bransford.</p>

<p>“Thanks. But you—you’re a tee-totaler?”
said Jeff.</p>

<p>“A—well—not exactly,” stammered
Aughinbaugh. “But I have to be very careful.
I—I only take one drink at a time!”
He fumbled out another glass.</p>

<p>“I stumble, I stumble!” said Bransford
gravely. He poured out a small drink and
passed the bottle. “‘I fill this cup to one
made up!’”—He held the glass up to the
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Well?” said Aughinbaugh, expectantly.
“Go on!”</p>

<p>“That description can’t be bettered,” said
Bransford.</p>

<p>“Never will I drink such a toast as that,”
cried Aughinbaugh, laughing. “Let me substitute,
Here’s to our better acquaintance!”</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AUGHINBAUGH closed the door behind
him and paused, vastly diverted.
His entrance had passed unnoted, muffled by
the jerky click-click of the typewriter on
which Jeff Bransford toiled with painful absorption.
On Jeff’s forehead little beads of
sweat stood out, glistening in the lamp-light.
He scanned the last line, scowled ferociously,
and snapped the platen back. His uncertain
fingers twitched solicitously above the keys.
Aughinbaugh chuckled offensively.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</div>
<div class="verse">He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>he declaimed.</p>

<p>Jeff whirled around. “Hello, here you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
are! Any news from our employer?” He
rose with a sigh of relief and mopped his
brow. “Gee! I’ve got to work the Jim-fidgets
out of my fingers.”</p>

<p>Ignoring the query, Aughinbaugh took a
step forward, drew up his slender frame, inflated
his chest, spread one hand upon it,
and threw up his other hand with a flourish
of limber fingers. “‘Now is the time,’” he
spouted forth at Bransford, mouthing the
well-known words, “‘for all good men and
true to come to the aid of the party!’”</p>

<p>Jeff grinned sheepishly. “I’ll dream that
cussed thing to-night. How long did it take
you to learn to play a tune on this fool contraption,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>“It took me three months—to play on it
anyhow. But then I already knew how to
spell. I’ve been at it two years since and am
still improving. I should estimate that you
would need about eight years. Better give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
it up. Try a maul or a piledriver. More
suited to your capabilities. Why, Jeff, a
really good stenographer can do first-class
work in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Eight years? George, you’re an optimist.
I’ve worked two solid hours on this
one ‘simple little sentence,’ as you call it, and
I’ve never got it right once. Sometimes I’ve
come within one letter of it. Once I made a
mighty effort and got all the letters right,
but I forgot to space and ran the words together.
And say—that simple little sentence
hasn’t got near all the letters in it. B, j, k,
q, v, x and z are left out.”</p>

<p>“Here, then—here’s one that contains
every letter: ‘A quick move by the enemy
will jeopardize six fine gunboats.’”</p>

<p>Jeff pulled pad and pencil to him. “Give
me that again and I’ll take it down.” Repeating
the alphabet slowly, he canceled each
letter as he went. “Right you are! Say, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
fellow that got that up was on the job, wasn’t
he? Why didn’t you give me this one in the
first place? Wonder if it’s possible to get
’em all in another sentence as short?”</p>

<p>“I think not,” said Aughinbaugh. “It’s
been tried. But I don’t share your admiration
for the last one. Besides reeking of militarism
abhorrent to my peaceful disposition,
it is stiff, labored, artificial and insincere.
Compare it with the spontaneity, the beauty,
the stately cadences, the sonorous fire, the
sweep and swing of the simple, natural
appeal: ‘<i>Now</i> is the time for all good
men and true to come to the aid of the
party!’”</p>

<p>If it has ever been your privilege to observe
a wise old she-bear watching her cubs
at play and to note the expression of her face—half
patience, tolerance, resignation; the
remainder pride and approval—you will know
exactly how Jeff looked. As for Aughinbaugh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
he bore himself grandly, chin up. His
voice was vibrant, resonant, purposeful; his
eyes glowed with serious and lofty enthusiasm:
no muscle quivered to a smile.</p>

<p>“Why, there is philosophy in it! The
one unvarying factor of the human mind,”
he went on, “is the firm, unbiased conviction
that I am right, and all opposition necessarily,
consciously and wilfully wrong. This belief
is the base and foundation of all human institutions,
of sectionalism, caste, creeds, parties,
states, of patriotism itself. It is the
premise on which all wars are based. Mark,
now, how human nature speaks from its elemental
depths in the calm, complacent, but
entirely sincere assumption that all good men
and true will be unconditionally with the
party!”</p>

<p>He warmed to his subject; he strode back
and forth; he smote open palm with clenched
fist in vehement gesture. Jeff snickered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
George rebuked him with a stern and withering
glance.</p>

<p>“I grant you that b, j, k, q, v, x and z
are omitted. But what are b, j, k, q, v, x
and z in comparison to the chaste perfection
of this immortal line? Let them fitly typify
the bad men and false who do not come to
the aid of the party. Injustice is only what
they deserve!”</p>

<p>Consigning b, j, k, q, v, x and z to outer
darkness with scornful, snapping fingers, he
poured a glass of water, sipped it slowly, with
resolute suppression of his Adam’s apple,
fixed Jeff with another severe glance, paused
impressively, rose to his tiptoes with both
hands outspread, and continued:</p>

<p>“Why, sir, this is the grandest line in literature!
It should hang on every wall, a
text worked on a sampler by tender, loving
hands! It is a ready-made watchword, a
rallying cry for any great cause! It might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
be sung by marching thousands. When, in
a great crisis, the mighty statesman, the intellectual
giant between whose puny legs we
petty men do creep and peer about, has proclaimed
the Fla-ag in Danger; has led us to
stand at the parting of the ways; has shown
that the nation must make irrevocable choice
of good or evil; when our hearts are thrilled
with the consciousness of our own virtue——”
he sprang to a chair and flaunted his handkerchief
in rhythmical waves—“this, then, is
his crashing peroration: ‘Now is the time for
all good men and true to come to the aid
of the party!’”</p>

<p>Bowing gracefully, he carefully parted
imaginary coat-tails and seated himself, beaming.</p>

<p>Jeff lolled contentedly back in his chair,
puffing out clouds of smoke. “That’s a fine
line of talk you get out. You sure did a
wise thing when you quit the bank and took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
to studying law. You have all the qualifications
for a successful lawyer—or a barker for
a sideshow.” He tapped out his pipe and
yawned lazily. “I infer from your slurring
remarks about solemn, silly twaddle that you
are not permanently tagged, classified, labeled
and catalogued, politically?”</p>

<p>“I am a consistent and humble follower,”
replied George, “of the wise Democritus,
who, as I will explain for the benefit of
your benighted ignorance, is known as the
Laughing Philosopher. I laugh. Therefore
I can truthfully say, to paraphrase
the words of a famous leader, ‘I am a
Democrit!’”</p>

<p>Jeff showed his teeth. “I guess I am, too—but
I didn’t know what it was till you told
me. Now I have a party, at last—and now
is the time for all good men and true—and
that reminds me, my young and exuberant
friend, that you have not yet told me when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
our esteemed and respected employer intends
to return.”</p>

<p>“I do not quite like the tone you adopt
in speaking of Mr. Simon Hibler,” said
George icily. “It smacks of irreverence and
presumption. Still less do I relish your persistent
reference to him as ‘our’ employer.
It amounts to an assumption of a certain
equality in our respective positions that I cannot
for an instant tolerate.” He strutted to
the hearthrug and turned his back to the fire;
he fiddled with his watch-chain; tone and
manner were heavily pompous. “In a way,
of course, Mr. Hibler might be said to employ
us both. But I would have you realize
that a vast gulf separates the social status of
a lowly cow-servant, stolid and stunned, a
brother to the ox, from that of an embryo
Blackstone—like myself. I accept a position
and receive a salary. You take a job
and draw wages. Moreover, a lawyer’s clerk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
marries the youngest daughter and is taken
into the firm. By the way, Hibler has no
daughter. I must remind him of this. ‘Hibler
&amp; Aughinbaugh, Counselors at Law.’
That’ll look good in silver letters on a sanded,
dark-blue background, eh, Jefferson? But
soft! methinks my natural indignation has diverted
me from your question. No, my good
fellow, I do not know when Mr. Hibler is
returning to El Paso. Are you already tired
of urban delights, Mr. Bransford?”</p>

<p>“I was tired of urban delights,” remarked
Mr. Bransford, “before you were out of
short dresses. However, I’ve waited this
long and I’ll stay right here in El Paso till
he comes. I bore myself some, daytimes,
but we have bully good times of nights.
You’re as good as a show—better. Tune up
your Julius Cæsar!”</p>

<p>“Your attitude—if you will overlook the
involuntary rhyme,” said George, “is one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
base ingratitude. I endeavor to instruct and
uplift you. You might be absorbing sweetness
and light at every pore, acquiring a love
for the true, the good and the beautiful—and
you are merely amused! It is disheartening.
As for this golden volume, this masterpiece
of William Shakspere’s genius—‘which,
pardon me, I do not mean to
read’——”</p>

<p>“Oh, go on! Of course you’re going to
read it. We’ve got almost through it. You
left off just beyond ‘the-will-give-us-the-will,
we-will-have-the-will.’”</p>

<p>“Why, you lazy pup, why didn’t you read
it yourself? You have nothing to do. I
have to work.”</p>

<p>“I did read it through to-day. And began
at the first again. But,” said Jeff
admiringly, “I like to hear you read
it. You have such a lovely voice, Mr.
Crow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Aughinbaugh bowed. “Thank you, Mr.
Bransford, thank you! But I am proof
against even such subtle and insidious flattery
as yours. Hereafter, sir, I shall read no
book through to you. I shall select works
suited to your parts and your station in life
and read barely enough to stimulate your
sluggish mind. Then you can shell corn or be
buried alive. To-night, for instance, I shall
read some salient extracts from Carlyle’s
‘French Revolution.’ You will not in the
least understand it, but your interest and
curiosity will be aroused. You will then finish
it, with such collateral reading as I shall
direct.”</p>

<p>“Sure you got all those ‘shalls’
and ‘wills’ just right?” suggested Jeff.
“It’s mighty easy to get ’em tangled
up.”</p>

<p>“That is the only proper way to study history,”
George went on, wisely ignoring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
interruption. “Read history lightly, about
some period, then read the best works of
poetry or fiction dealing with the same events.
Then come back to history again. The characters
will be real people to you and not mere
names. You will eagerly extend your researches
to details about these familiar acquaintances
and friends, and learn particulars
that you would else have shirked as dull and
laborious.” He took a book from the shelf.
“I will now read to you—after you replenish
the fire—a few chapters here and there, especially
there, dealing with the taking of the
Bastille.”</p>

<p>Without, a wild March wind shrilled and
moaned at the trembling casements; within,
firelight’s cozy cheer, Aughinbaugh’s slim
youth lit by the glowing circle of the shaded
lamp, the dusky corners beyond. The flexible
voice sank with pity or swelled with hot
indignation. And Bransford, as he listened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
to that stupendous, chaotic drama of incoherent
clangorous World Bedlam, saw, in the
glowing coals, tumultuous, dim-confused
figures come and go, passionate, terrible and
grim; the young, the gay, the beautiful, the
brave, the brave in vain; fire-hearted, vehement,
proud, swallowed up by delirium.
Newer shapes, wild, portentous, spluttering,
flashing, whirling, leaping in wild dervish
dance. In the black shadows, in the eddying
thick smoke, lurked crowding shapes more
terrible still, abominable, malignant, demoniacal,
imbecile—Proteus shapes that
changed, dwindled, leaped and roared to an
indistinguishable sulphurous whirlpool, sport
of all the winds. Brief flashes of clearer
light there were, as the smoke billowed aside;
faces gleamed a moment distinct, resolute,
indomitable, bright-sparkling; blazed high—and
fell, trampled down by fresh
legion-changing apparitions. Sad visions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
some monstrous, some heroic, all pitiful;
thronging innumerable, consuming and consumed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Likewise ashlar stones of the Bastille
continue thundering through the dusk; its
paper archives shall fly white. Old secrets
come to view; and long buried despair finds
voice. Read this portion of an old letter:
‘If for my consolation monseigneur would
grant me, for the sake of God and the most
blessed Trinity, that I should have news of
my dear wife; were it only her name on a
card to show that she is alive! It were the
greatest consolation I could receive; and I
should forever bless the greatness of monseigneur.’
Poor prisoner, who signest thyself
Quéret-Démery, and hast no other history,
she is dead, that dear wife of thine,
and thou art dead! ’Tis fifty years since
thy breaking heart put this question; to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
heard now first, and long heard, in the hearts
of men.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A long silence. The fire was low. One
dim, blurred form was there—an old man,
writing, in a stone cell.</p>

<p>Aughinbaugh closed the book. His eyes
were moist. “One of the greatest novels
ever written, ‘The Tale of Two Cities,’ is
based entirely upon and turns upon this last
paragraph. Read that to-morrow and then
come back to the ‘French Revolution.’ You’ll
be around to-morrow night?”</p>

<p>Jeff rose, laughing. “You remind me of
my roommate at school.”</p>

<p>“Your—what? Where?” said George in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ve been to school, but not very
long. When the boys used to stay too late
he’d yawn and say to me: ‘Jeff, perhaps we’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
better go to bed. These people may want to
go home!’”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it’s nearly twelve o’clock,” said
George, unabashed. “And I have to work
if you don’t. Bless you, my children, bless
you! Be happy and you will be good!
<i>Buenas noches!</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Buenas noches!</i>”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A trolley car whirred by, with scintillation
of blue-crackling sparks. Jeff elected to
walk, companied by his storied ghosts—their
footsteps sounded through the rustling leaves.
The wind was dead; the night was overcast,
dark and chill. Aughinbaugh’s lodgings
were in the outskirts of the residence section;
the streets at this hour were deserted. Jeff
had walked briskly for ten minutes when, as
he neared a corner in a quiet neighborhood,
he saw a tall man in gray come from the
farther side of the intersecting street just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
ahead. The gray man paused under the electric
light to let a recklessly-driven cab overtake
and pass him, and then turned diagonally
over toward Jeff, whistling as he came.
He was half-way across, and Jeff was within
a yard of the corner, when another man,
short and squat, hurried from the street to
the left, brushing by so close that Jeff might
have touched him. So unexpected was his
appearance—for his footsteps had been
drowned by the clattering cab—that Jeff was
startled. He paused, midstep, for the merest
fraction of a second. The town clock
boomed midnight.</p>

<p>Thereafter, events moved with all the
breathless unreality of dream. The second
man turned across to meet the first. A revolver
leaped up, shining in the light; he
fired point-blank. The gray man staggered
back. Yet, taken all unaware, so deadly swift
he was that both men fired now together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>Nor was Jeff imprudently idle. He was
in the line of fire, directly behind the short
man. To the left, across the sidewalk, the
hole of a tree was just visible beyond the
house corner. Jeff leaped for this friendly
shelter—and butted headlong into human
ribs.</p>

<p>A one-hundred-and-sixty-pound projectile
deals no light blow, and Jeff’s initial velocity
was the highest he could command at such
slight notice. The owner of the ribs reeled
out into the street, beyond the shadows. A
huge man, breathless, gasping, with a revolver
drawn; his thumb was on the hammer.
So much Jeff knew and closed on him, his
left hand clutched the gun, the hammer was
through his finger. They wrenched and tore
at the gun; and had the bigger man grappled
now he might have crushed Jeff at once,
broken him by main strength. But he was
a man of one idea—and he had a second gun.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
A violent jerk threw Jeff to his knee, but he
kept his desperate grip. The second gun
flashed in the giant’s left hand, rising and
falling with the frontier firing motion; but
Jeff’s own gun was out, he struck up the falling
death, the bullet sang above him. He
was on his feet, in trampling, unreal struggle;
again he struck the gun aside as it belched
fire. Turning, whirling, straining, Jeff was
dizzily conscious that the men beneath the
light were down, both still shooting; the cab
had stopped, men were running toward him
shouting. The giant’s dreadful strength
was undirected, heaving and thrusting purposeless;
time for order and response would
be time for crashing death to find him; his
one frantic thought was to shoot first, to shoot
fast. Shaken, tossed and thrown, Jeff kept
his feet, kept his head, kept close in; as the
great man’s gun rose and fell he parried with
his own. Three shots, four—the others fired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
no longer; five—one more—Six! It was
warded, Jeff drew back, fired his first shot
from his hip; the giant dragged at him, heaved
forward, and struck out mightily, hammerwise.
Jeff saw the blow gleaming down as
he fired again. Glint of myriad lights
streamed sparkwise across an infinite blackness;
he knew no more.</p>

<p>The clock was still striking.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“HE’S coming round. That man’s suhtenly
got a cast-iron skull. Such a
blow with a .45 would ’a’ killed most fellers.
What you goin’ to do with him, Judge?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. It strikes me that he
would be a valuable man for us. That was
the nerviest performance I ever saw. Had
I been told that any one could mix it that
way with Oily Broderick and two guns, and
get off with it scot-free except for this little
love tap, I should never have believed it.”
The voice was rich, clear, slow, well-modulated.
“Perhaps he may be induced to join
us. If not——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>The words reached Jeff from immeasurable
distances. He was floating on a particularly
soft and billowy cloud at the time:
a cloud with a buoyant and undulant motion,
very soothing. Jeff noted it with approval.
Underneath and a little ahead, a high and
exceedingly steep mountain rose abruptly
from the sea. It was built entirely of piled,
roundish boulders. The contour seemed
familiar. Madagascar, of course! How
clever of him to remember! Jeff turned the
cloud. It sank in slow and graceful spirals
to the peak. Doubtless the voices came from
there. The words seemed to have an unexplained
connection with some circumstance
that he could not quite recall. He felt the
elusive memory slipping away. However,
it made no difference. He drifted into a
delicious vagueness.</p>

<p>Something hard was forced between his
teeth; a fiery liquid trickled down his throat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
He gasped and struggled; his eyes fluttered
open. To his intense disappointment the
cloud was gone. An arm was propping him
up. Mysterious blankets appeared before
him from somewhere or other. On them lay
an arm and a bandaged hand. The hand
was hurting some one very much. Jeff wondered
whose it was. He looked at the hand
fixedly for a long time and, on further examination,
found it to be his own. Here
was a pretty state of affairs!</p>

<p>A pillow was thrust behind him and the
supporting arm withdrawn. At once he felt
a throbbing pain in his head. He put his
hand up and lo! his head was also heavily
bandaged! He regretted Madagascar more
than ever. He settled back for reflection.
Looking up, after a little, he saw a chair with
the back turned toward him; astride the
chair, a middle-aged man, large, clean-shaven,
rosy, well-dressed, and, as it seemed to Jeff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
unnecessarily cheerful. His eyes twinkled;
his hands, which were white and plump and
well kept, played a little ditty on the chair-back.
There was a ruby on one finger. Beyond
him sat a gross, fat man with a stubbly
beard, a coarse, flat nose and little, piggish,
red eyes. His legs were crossed and he
smoked a villainous pipe. There were other
men behind these two. Jeff was just turning
to look at them when his attention was recalled
by a voice from the man astride the
chair.</p>

<p>“And how are we now, my young friend?
A trifle dazed, I fancy? Something of a
headache?” He showed his white teeth in
a friendly smile; his voice was soft and playful.
“Are we well enough to eat something?
What with our recent disagreeable
shock and our long abstinence from food, we
must find ourself rather feeble.”</p>

<p>Jeff stared at the man while he digested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
this communication. “A little coffee,” he
said at last. “I can’t eat anything now. I
am dizzy and most everlasting sick at my
stomach. Put out that damned pipe!”</p>

<p>The soft-voiced man chuckled delightedly,
as if he found this peremptory command exquisitely
humorous. “You hear, Borrowman?
Evidently Mr. Bransford is of those
who want what they want when they want
it. Bring a little soup, too. He’ll feel better
after he drinks his coffee.”</p>

<p>The man addressed as Borrowman disappeared
with a shuffling gait. Jeff lay back
and considered. His half-shut eyes wandered
around. Whitewashed stone walls, a
heavily-ironed door, no window—that was
queer, too!—floor and ceiling of rough
boards, a small fireplace, two chairs, a pine
table, a lighted lamp. That was all. His
gaze came back to the man in the chair, to
find that gentleman’s large blue eyes watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
him with a quizzical and humorous look—a
look highly suggestive of a cat enjoying
a little casual entertainment with a mouse.
In his weakened condition Jeff found this
feline regard disconcerting.</p>

<p>The coffee came, and the soup. After
Jeff’s refreshment the man in the chair rose.
“We will leave you to the care of our good
Borrowman,” he said, baring his white, even
teeth. “I will be back this evening and, if
you are stronger, we will then discuss some
rather momentous affairs. Go to sleep now.”</p>

<p>The caressing advice seemed good. Jeff
was just dropping off when a disturbing
thought intruded itself.</p>

<p>This evening? Then it must be day now.
Why did they burn a lamp in daytime? The
problem was too much for Jeff. Still pondering
it, he dozed off.</p>

<p>When he woke the lamp was yet burning;
the objectionable fat man sat by the fire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
When he turned his head, presently, Jeff was
startled to observe that this man had got
hold of an entirely new set of features. Here
was an extraordinary thing! Hard features,
and unprepossessing still, but clean at least.
How very curious!</p>

<p>After a while a simple solution presented
itself. It was not the same man at all!
Jeff wondered why he had not hit upon that
at first. It seemed that he had now become
a body entirely surrounded by fat men—no—that
wasn’t right. “Let me—let me name
the Supreme Court of a nation and I care not
who makes the laws.” No, that was John
Wesley Pringle’s gag. Good old Wes’!
Wonder where he is? He wasn’t fat. How
did that go? Oh, yes! “Let me have men
about me that are fat!”—Something
snapped—and Jeff remembered.</p>

<p>Not all at once. He lay silent, with closed
eyes, and pieced together scraps of recollection,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
here and there, bit by bit. It was like
a picture puzzle; so much so that Jeff quite
identified each random memory with some
definite shape, eagerly fitting them together
in a frame; and, when he had adjusted them
satisfactorily to a perfect square, fell peacefully
asleep.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN he woke the soft-voiced, white-handed
man again sat beside the
bed, again in the same equestrian attitude,
clasping the back of the chair, beaming with
good humor.</p>

<p>“And how is our young friend now?
Much better, I trust. We have had a long
and refreshing sleep. Is our brain quite
clear?”</p>

<p>Here the fat man—the less ill-favored one—rose
silently from beside the fire and left
them.</p>

<p>“Our young friend is extremely hungry,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
said Jeff. “Our young friend’s brain is clear,
but our young friend’s head is rather sore.
Where am I? In jail?” He sat up and
pushed back the bandage for clearer vision.</p>

<p>The jovial gentleman laughed—a merry
and mellow peal. “What a spirited fellow
you are! And what an extremely durable
headpiece you have! A jail? Well, not
exactly, my dear fellow, not exactly. Let
us say, in a cache, in a retreat, sometimes
used by gentlemen wishing temporary retirement
from society. You are also, though
I grieve to say it, in a jackpot—to use a
phrase the precise meaning and origin of
which I do not comprehend, but which seems
to be, in the vernacular, a synonym for the
more common word predicament.” He
shook his head sorrowfully. “A very sad
predicament, indeed! Quite unintentionally,
and in obedience to a chivalrous impulse—which
does you great credit, I assure you—you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> 
have had the misfortune to mar a very-well-laid
plan of mine. Had I not been a
quick thinker, marvelously fertile in expedients,
your officiousness would have placed me
in an awkward quandary. However, in the
very brief time at my disposal I was able to
hit upon a device equally satisfactory—I
may say even more satisfactory than the
original.”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” said Jeff. “I don’t quite
keep up. You planned a midnight assassination
which did not go off smoothly. I’ve got
that. You were one of the men in the cab.
There was a fight——”</p>

<p>“There was, indeed!” interrupted the
genial gentleman. His eyes lit up with enthusiasm;
his shapely fingers tapped the chair-back.
“Such a fight! It was magnificent!
Believe me, my dear Bransford, it inspired
me with an almost affectionate admiration
for you! And your opponent was a most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
redoubtable person, with a sensitive trigger
finger——”</p>

<p>“Excuse the interruption,” said Jeff.
“But you seem to have the advantage of me
in the matter of names.”</p>

<p>“So I have, so I have! As you will infer,
I looked through your pockets. Thorpe is
my name—S. S. Thorpe. Stay—here is my
card. You will see that I am entitled to
the prefix ‘Hon.,’ having been sometime
State Senator. Call me Judge. I have
never occupied that exalted position, but all
the boys call me Judge. To go back—we
were speaking of your opponent. Perhaps
you knew him? No? Mr. Broderick, Mr.
Oily Broderick, once of San Antonio, a man
of some renown. We shall miss him, Mr.
Bransford, we shall miss him! A very useful
fellow! But your eyes ask the question—Dead?
Dear me, yes! Dead and buried
these many hours. He never knew what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
ailed him. Both of your bullets found a
vital spot. A sad loss! But I interrupt.
I am much interested to see how nearly accurate
your analysis of the situation will be.”</p>

<p>“The short man—was he killed, too?”
asked Jeff.</p>

<p>“The worthy Krouse was killed as well,”
said Judge Thorpe, sighing with comfortable
resignation. “But Krouse was a negligible
quantity. Amiable, but a bungler. Go
on!”</p>

<p>“Your intended victim seems to have
escaped——”</p>

<p>“Survived,” corrected Judge Thorpe
gently, with complacent inspection of his
shapely hands. “Survived is the better
word, believe me. Captain Charles Tillotson,
Captain of the Rangers. An estimable
gentleman, with whom, I grieve to say, I was
not on the best of terms. To our political
enmity, of long standing—and you perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
know that Southwestern politics are extremely
bitter—has been added of late a certain social
rivalry. But I digress. You were saying——”</p>

<p>“But you are prompting me,” said Jeff
testily. “It is hardly necessary. Your
enemy not being killed outright, you choose
to assassinate his good name, juggling appearances
to make it seem that he was the
murderer—and to that end you have spirited
me away.”</p>

<p>“Exactly! You are a man after my own
heart—a man of acumen and discernment,”
said Judge Thorpe, beaming, “although I
did, as you suggest, prompt you at some
points—knowing that you were not familiar
with all the premises. Really, Mr. Bransford,
though I would not unduly exalt myself,
I cannot help but think my little device
showed more than mere talent. It was, considering
the agitating circumstances, considering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
that both conception and execution had
to be instantaneous, little less than Napoleonic!
I feel sure that when I tell you
the details you will share my enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>Jeff was doing some quick thinking. He
recalled what he had heard of Thorpe. He
was best known as a powerful and wealthy
politician of El Paso, who in his younger
days had been a dangerous gunfighter. Of
late years, however, he had become respected
and reputable, his youthful foibles forgotten.</p>

<p>The appalling frankness of this avowal
could bode no good to Jeff. Evidently he
was helplessly in this man’s power, and his
life had been spared for some sinister and
shameful purpose.</p>

<p>“Before you favor me with any more details,
Judge,” said Jeff, “can’t you give me
an old boot to chew on?”</p>

<p>“What wonderful spirits, what splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
nerves! I compliment you!” said the Judge.
“Our good Mac went, when you first awoke,
to prepare steak, eggs and coffee for you.
You will pardon us if we do not have your
meals brought in from a restaurant. It
would not do. We are quiet here, we do not
court observation. For the same reason we
have been forced to abstain from medical
attendance for you, otherwise so desirable.
I, myself, have filled that office to the best
of my ability. Now as to the replenishing
of the inner man. Mac is an excellent cook.”</p>

<p>“Cleaner than Borrowman,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>“And is, as you observe, much cleaner
than Borrowman. He will prepare whatever
the market affords. You have only to
ask. And, while we are waiting, I will return
to my story.”</p>

<p>“I was, as you so readily surmised, in the
cab, together with my good friend, colleague
and lieutenant, Mr. Sam Patterson. We had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
telephoned ahead to Krouse and Broderick
that Tillotson was on his way. We were to
be witnesses that Krouse acted purely in self-defense,
you know—as, indeed, were also the
cab driver and Broderick. Broderick was
to hold himself in reserve and not to assist,
except in case of mishap. We supposed that
Krouse would kill Tillotson without difficulty.
Krouse bungled. He inflicted three wounds,
painful but not dangerous; including one
which creased the scalp and produced unconsciousness.”</p>

<p>The man took such shameless delight in
parading his wickedness that Jeff began to
wonder if, after all, it would not have saved
himself much difficulty if Broderick had
killed him. But he set his mind like a flint
to thwart this smiling monster at any cost.</p>

<p>The Judge went on: “Such was the distressing
situation when I came up. Some
men would have finished Tillotson on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
spot. But I kept my presence of mind; I
exercised admirable self-restraint. It would
be but an instant before the aroused neighborhood
would be on the street. We bundled
you and your gun into the cab and the driver
hurried you away to a certain rendezvous of
ours. To have done with the driver, I will
say at this time that he came in and gave
his testimony the next day very effectively,
fully confirming ours; accounting for his conduct
by the very natural excuse that he was
scared and so ran away lest he should be
shot.</p>

<p>“The gun in Broderick’s right hand, you
may remember, had not been fired. His
stiffening fingers still held it. I picked up
his other gun, unbuckled his belt, buckled it
around Tillotson, and dropped Broderick’s
empty gun by him. No more was needed.
The populace found me caring for Captain
Tillotson like a brother, pouring whisky down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
him—and thereby heaping coals of fire on his
head.</p>

<p>“Now, as to our evidence. As you may
readily guess, we were driving by when the
trouble began. We saw Captain Tillotson
when he fired the first shot, killing Broderick
with it. He continued to shoot after Broderick
dropped; Krouse, defending his friend,
was killed also, wounding Tillotson, who
kept on shooting blindly after he fell. The
circumstantial evidence, too, was damning,
and bore us out in every respect. Broderick,
a man of deadly quickness, had been killed
before he could shoot. Tillotson had emptied
one gun and fired four shots from the
other; his carrying two guns pointed toward
deliberate, fore-planned murder. The marks
on the houses, made by a number of his wild
bullets, were in a line directly beyond Broderick’s
body from where Tillotson lay. Broderick
was between you and the others, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
know,” explained the Judge parenthetically.
“But as nothing is known of you, the marks
of Broderick’s bullets are supposed to be
made by Tillotson’s—incontrovertible evidence
that he began the fighting.”</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more hateful,
more revolting, than this bland, smiling complacency:
Jeff’s fingers itched to be at his
throat. It became clear to him that either
this man would be his death, or, which was
highly improbable, the other way about.
His resolution hardened; he began to have
visions of this smiling face above a noose.</p>

<p>“When Tillotson regained consciousness
he told a most amazing story, obviously conflicting
with the facts. He had carried but
one gun; Krouse had made a wanton attack
upon him, without warning; he had returned
the fire. Simultaneously Broderick had been
killed by some fourth man, a stranger, whom
Tillotson did not know, and who had mysteriously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
disappeared when the people of the
neighborhood arrived. It looks very black
for Captain Tillotson,” purred the Judge,
shaking his hands and head sorrowfully.
“Even those who uphold him do not credit
this wildly-improbable tale. It is universally
thought that his wealth and position will not
save him from the noose. El Paso is reforming;
El Paso is weary of two-gun men.</p>

<p>“And now, my dear Bransford, comes the
crucial point, a matter so delicate that I hesitate
to touch upon it. All of my ingenious
little impromptu was built and founded on
the natural hypothesis of your demise, which,
in my haste, I did not stop to verify. It
did not occur to me as among the possibilities
that any man—even myself—could weather
six shots, at hand-grips, from Oily Broderick.
Imagine, then, my surprise and chagrin when
I learned that you were not even seriously
hurt! It was a shock, I assure you! But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
here comes Mac with the tray. I will bathe
your hands, Mr. Bransford. Then I beg
that you will fall to at once. We will discourse
while you break your fast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can get up,” said Jeff. “I’m not
hurt. Put it on the table.”</p>

</div></div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">“I&#8202; PERCEIVE,” said the Judge, surveying
the tempting viands, “that Mac
has thoughtfully cut your meat for you. You
are provided with many spoons, but neither
knife nor fork. A wise and wholesome precaution,
I may remark. After your recent
exploit we stand quite in awe of you. Pray
be seated. I will take a cup of coffee with
you—if you will allow me?</p>

<p>“It will not have escaped a man of your
penetration that an obvious course was open
to me. But your gallantry had quite won
my heart, and I refrained from that obvious
course, though strongly urged to it. Mac,
tell Mr. Bransford what your advice was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“I said: ‘Dead men tell no tales!’” replied
Mac sturdily. “And I say it again.
Yon is a fearsome man.”</p>

<p>“You are a dangerous man yourself, Mac.
Yet I trust you. And why? Because,” said
the Judge cooingly, “I am more dangerous
still—leader by right of the strongest. I
admire you, Mr. Bransford; I needed such
a man as you seem to be. Moreover, singular
as it may seem, I boggled at cutting you
off in cold blood. I have as good a heart
as can be made out of brains. You had not
intentionally harmed me; I bore you no
grudge; it seemed a pity. I decided to give
you a chance. I refused this advice. If
you but knew it, Mr. Bransford, you owe
me a heavy debt of gratitude. So we brought
you across quite unostentatiously. That
brings us up to date.</p>

<p>“You see the logic of the situation, my
dear fellow? Your silence must be insured.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Either you must throw in your lot with us,
commit yourself entirely and irrevocably to
us, or suffer the consequences of—shall we
say, your indiscretion?”</p>

<p>The Judge sipped his coffee daintily. “It
is distressing even to mention the alternative;
it is needless to lay undue emphasis upon it;
circumstances have already done that. You
see for yourself that it must be thus, and
not otherwise.”</p>

<p>Jeff took a toothpick, pushed his chair
back and crossed his legs comfortably. “I
must have time to consider the matter and
look at it from all sides,” he said meditatively.
“But I can tell you now how it
strikes me at first blush. Do you believe
in presentiments, Judge?”</p>

<p>The Judge shook his head. “I am singularly
free from all superstition.”</p>

<p>“Now, I do,” said Jeff steadily, his face
wearing as engaging an expression as its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
damaged condition would permit. “And I
have a very strong presentiment that I shall
see you hung, or perhaps I should say,
hanged.”</p>

<p>The Judge went off in another peal of
laughter. Even the saturnine Mac relaxed
to a grim smile. The Judge pounded on
the table. “But what a droll dog it is!”
he cried. “Positively, I like you better
every moment. Such high spirits! Such
hardihood! Really, we need you, we must
have you. I cannot imagine any one better
fitted to fill the place of the departed brother
whom you—as the instrument of an inscrutable
and all-wise Providence—have removed
from our midst.”</p>

<p>At this disloyalty to the dead, Jeff’s gorge
rose at the man; treacherous, heartless, revolting.
But he kept a tranquil, untroubled
face. The Judge went on: “Your resolution
may change. You will suffer from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
ennui. I may mention that, should you join
us, the pecuniary reward will be great. I
am wealthy and powerful, and our little organization—informal,
but very select—shares
my fortunes. They push me up from
below and I pull them up from above. I
will add that we seldom find it necessary to
resort to such extreme measures as we did
in the Tillotson case. He was a very troublesome
man; he has been a thorn in my side
for years.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, we conduct many open
and perfectly-legitimate enterprises, political,
legal, financial. We are interested in mining
propositions; we have cattle ranches in
Texas and Old Mexico; we handle real
estate. As side lines, we do a miscellaneous
business—smuggle a vast amount of opium
and a few Chinamen, keep sanctuary for unhappy
fugitives, jump good mines and sell
poor ones, furnish or remove witnesses—Oh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
many things! But, perhaps, our greatest
activity is simply to exert moral pressure in
aid of our strictly-legitimate enterprises.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut! I have been so charmed that
I have overstayed my time. Think this matter
over carefully, my dear fellow. There
is much to gain or to lose. You shall have
ample time for consideration. Mac and
Borrowman will get you anything you want,
within the bounds of reason—clothes, books,
tobacco, such knickknacks. And, by the
way, here are yesterday’s papers. You may
care to read the Tillotson case. The editorials,
both those that condemn him and
those that defend, are particularly amusing.”</p>

<p>“Mac and Borrowman are to be my jailers?”
said Jeff.</p>

<p>The Judge raised his hands in expostulation.
“Jailers?” he repeated. “What a
harsh term! Let us say, companions. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
might break out of jail,” said the Judge,
tapping Jeff’s breast with his strong fingers,
“but you will not get away from me. They
will tell you their instructions. I will
attend to your hurts, now, and then I must
go.”</p>

<p>“I would like clean clothes,” said Jeff,
while the Judge dressed his wounds skilfully.
“A safety razor—they can keep it when I’m
not using it—the daily papers, cigars, tobacco—let
me see, what else? Oh, yes—I
was trying to learn the typewriter. I’d
like to try it again when my finger gets better.
For books, send in Shakspere’s works
and Carlyle’s ‘French Revolution,’ for the
present.”</p>

<p>“You’re quite sure that’s all?” said the
Judge, entertained and delighted. “You
must intend to take your time about making
up your mind.”</p>

<p>“My mind is entirely made up now. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
would insure you against a watery death,”
said Jeff with utmost calmness, “for a
dime!”</p>

<p>“We shall see, we shall see!” said the
Judge skeptically. “Time works many
wonders. You will be ennuied! I prophesy
it. Besides, I count upon your gratitude.
Good-night!”</p>

<p>“Good-night!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>So you “brought me unostentatiously
across,” did you? You made a slip that time.
You talk well, Judge, but you talk too much.
Across? Across the Rio Grande. I am in
Juarez. I had already guessed it, for I
hear the sounds of many whistling engines
from far off, and but few from near at hand.
My prison is underground, since those
whistles are the only sounds that reach me,
and they muffled and indistinct; coming by
the fireplace. That chimney goes through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
a house above, since they keep up a fire.
What to do?</p>

<p>Through the long hours he lay on his bed,
sleepless. When he opened his eyes, at intervals,
it was always to find the guard’s face
toward him, watching him intently. They
were taking no chances.</p>

<p>His vigorous brain was busy with the possibilities;
contriving, hopeless as the situation
might seem, more than one scheme, feasible
only to desperation, and with terrible odds
against success. These he put by to be used
only as a last recourse, and fell to his Sisyphean
task again with such concentration of
all his powers upon the work in hand as few
men have ever dreadful need to attain—such
focused concentration that, had his mind
been an actual searchlight, capable, in its
turning, to throw a shining circle upon actual,
living, moving men, in all places, far or near,
in time past, present or to come—where it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
paused, the places, men and events could not
have been more real, more clear, more
brightly illumined. When this inner light
wearied and grew faint he turned it back till
it pierced the thick walls to another prison,
dwelt on another prisoner there: a tall, gray
figure, whose face was turned away; ringed
round with hate, with ignominy, shame despair
and death; not friendless. And the
light rose again, strong and unwavering,
ranging the earth for what help was there;
so fell at last upon a plan, not after to be
altered. A rough plan only—the details to
be worked out—to-morrow and to-morrow.
So thinking, utter exhaustion came upon him
and he fell asleep.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">“AND what are these famous instructions
of yours, Mae?”</p>

<p>“They are verra precise, Mr. Bransford.
One of us will be always in the room. That
one will keep close and constant watch upon
you, even when you are asleep. Your wound
will be dressed only when we are both here.
Coal and water, your meals, the things you
send for, will be brought in only when we
are both here. And on any slightest eendication
of an attempted rescue or escape we
are to kill you without hesitation!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>It was plain that Mac was following the
manner as well as the matter of his instructions.
He gave this information slowly,
with dour satisfaction, checking each item
by forcibly doubling down, with his right
hand, the fingers of his left. Having now
doubled them all down, he undoubled them
and began again.</p>

<p>“If you attempt to give any alarm, if you
attempt to make any attack, if on any pretext
you try to get near enough for a possible
attack, we will kill you without hesitation.”
He rolled the phrase under his tongue with
great relish.</p>

<p>“Your precautions are most flattering,
I’m sure,” said Jeff idly. “I must be very
careful. The room is large, but I might inadvertently
break your last rule at any time.
If I understand you correctly, should I so
much as drop my pencil and, picking it up,
forgetfully come too close——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“I will shoot you,” repeated this uncompromising
person, “without any hesitation.
I have a verra high opeenion of your powers,
Mr. Bransford, and have no mind to come
to grips wi’ you. You will keep your distance,
and we will agree fine.”</p>

<p>“All this is like to be very tiresome to
you.” Jeff’s tones were level and cheerful;
he leaned back in his chair, yawning; his
hands were clasped behind his head. “Such
constant vigilance will be a strain upon you;
your nerves will be affected. I will have
by far the best of it. I can sleep, read,
think. But if you turn your head, if you
close your eyes, if you so much as falter in
your attention,” said Jeff dispassionately,
“my fingers will be at your throat to
tear your life out for the dog that you
are!”</p>

<p>“Why, now we understand each other
perfectly,” returned Mac, in nowise discomposed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
“But I would have ye to observe
that your last remark was highly discourteous.
My instructions are not yet ended.
Look now!” He held up his hand, with
three fingers still tightly closed to indicate
three several unhesitancies. “Our last instruction
was to treat you with ceeveelity and
consideration, to give you any indulgence
which would not endanger your safe keeping,
to subject you to no indignity or abuse.”
He folded down the fourth finger and extended
his closed hand, thrusting out his
thumb reproachfully. “To no abuse!” he
repeated.</p>

<p>“I am properly rebuked,” said Jeff. “I
withdraw the ‘dog.’ Let me amend the
offending remark to read thus: ‘to tear out
your life without any hesitation.’ But even
the remarkable foresight of Judge Thorpe
seems to have overlooked one important
thing. I refer to the possible corruption of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
my jailers. Do I likewise forfeit my life
if I tamper with your integrity?”</p>

<p>His grim guardian chose to consider this
query as extremely facetious. His leathern
face wrinkled to cavernous gashes, indicative
of mirth of a rather appalling sort; he
emitted a low rumble that might be construed,
in a liberal translation, as laughter;
his words took on a more Scottish twist.
“You might try it on Borrowman,” he said.
“Man, you’ve a taking way with you! ’Tis
fair against my advice and sober judgment
that ye are here at all—but I am begeening
to feel your fasceenations! Now that ye’re
here I e’en have the hope that ye will be weel
advisit. I own it, I would be but loath to
feed so gay and so plain-dealing a man to
the feeshes!”</p>

<p>These two had many such skirmishes as
the days went by: slow, dragging days, perpetually
lamp-lit, their passage measured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
only by the irregularly-changing guards and
the regular bringing in of the daily papers.</p>

<p>Jeff timed his sleeping hours to come on
Borrowman’s trick; finding that jailer dull,
ferocious and unendurable. His plan was
long since perfected, and now he awaited
but the opportunity of putting it into execution.</p>

<p>The Judge had called—as a medical adviser,
he said—pronounced Jeff’s progress all
that could be desired, and touched upon their
affair with argument, cajolery and airy badinage.
Jeff had asked permission to write
to his wife, to send some message, which the
Judge might dictate; any sort of a story, he
implored, to keep her from alarm and
anxiety; which petition the Judge put merrily
by, smiling at the absurdity of such request.</p>

<p>In his waking hours Jeff read the papers.
Tillotson was mending, his trial would be
soon. He read his books, sometimes aloud;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
he chaffed his jailer; he practised on the
typewriter, but never, in his practice, wrote
off any appeal for aid to good men and true,
or even the faintest suggestion that a quick
move by the enemy would jeopardize any
possible number of gunboats. Instead, Jeff
undertook to produce another “speed sentence.”
He called Mac to his assistance,
explaining his wants; and between them, with
great glee, they concocted the following gem:</p>

<p class="center"><i>He kept vexing me with frantic journeys
hidden by quiet zeal.</i></p>

<p>They showed this effusion to the Judge
with much pride, defying him to better it.
Jeff pounded it off by the hour; he mingled
fragments of it with his remarks in season
and out.</p>

<p>There were long visits from the Judge.
In his own despite Jeff grew to enjoy them
and to look forward to them—so strange a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
thing is man! The Judge was witty, cynical,
informed, polished, keen, satirical. At
times Jeff almost forgot what thing he was
besides. Their talk ranged on many things,
always in the end coming back to the same
smiling query, the same unfaltering reply.
Once, Patterson came with him—a younger
man, with a brutal and bloated face—and
urged the closing of the incident in clear and
unmistakable terms.</p>

<p>And, as day followed day, Jeff let it appear—as
a vital part of his plan—in his
speech, his manner, his haggard looks, that
danger, suspense and confinement were telling
upon him, that he was worried and
harassed, that he was losing his nerve. These
things appeared slowly, lest he should seem
to weaken too soon and too easily.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“MY iron-headed friend,” said the
Judge—“and I use the word in
more senses than one—you have now had
ample time for deliberation. I have given
you the opportunity to choose—life——”</p>

<p>No menace, no violence, could have left an
impression so strong, so dreadful in its
finality, as this brief ellipsis, the casual, light-hearted
manner.</p>

<p>“——at no slight risk to myself. Because,
the admiration, the liking which I have professed
to you is real and sincere enough,
though, perhaps, none of the deepest. I will
be quite frank with you, Mr. Bransford; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
liking, that admiration has grown with our
acquaintance. A weakness; I admit it; it
would be with a real regret that I should
speak the word to cut that acquaintance
short. I will be so much further frank with
you as to say that I fancy I can sufficiently
steel myself to speak that word should you
again refuse good counsel. This may be the
last of our pleasant meetings. For the last
time, in the words of your favorite writer:
‘Under which king, Bezonian? Speak, or
die!’”</p>

<p>Jeff’s hands gripped visibly at his chair-arms,
so that the Judge observed it—as was
intended—and smiled. But Jeff gave his
answer quietly: “I can’t do it. If you had
killed Tillotson outright I might, to save my
life, keep silence and let you go unpunished.
But I can’t do this.”</p>

<p>“You mean you won’t,” said the Judge
acidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“I mean that I can’t,” said Jeff. “I
would if I could, but I can’t.”</p>

<p>“By Heavens, I believe you will stick to
it!” said the Judge, greatly disappointed.
“Had you couched your refusal in some
swelling phrase—and I can think of a dozen
sonorous platitudes to fit the case—I might
yet have hopes of you. I believe, sir, that
you are a stubborn fellow. The man is
nothing to you!”</p>

<p>“The man is much to me,” returned Jeff.
“He is innocent.”</p>

<p>“So, I believe, are you. How will it help
him for you to die? And so obscurely,
too! I think,” said the Judge gently,
flicking at his cuff, “that you mentioned
a wife? Yes? And children? Two, I
think. Two boys?”</p>

<p>His elbows were upon the table, his white
hands were extended upon the table, he held
his head a little to one side and contemplated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
his fingers as they played a little tune there,
quite as if it were a piano.</p>

<p>Jeff’s face worked; he rose and paced the
floor. Mac, by the door, regarded him with
something very like compassion in his hard
face. The Judge watched him with feline
amusement.</p>

<p>When he came back he passed by his chair;
he stood beside the table, resting his fingers
lightly on the typewriter frame. “Life is
dear to me,” he said, with a slight break in
his voice. “I will make this one concession.
More I will not do. Tillotson’s trial is
half over; the verdict is certain; there are
powerful influences at work to insure the
denial of an appeal and to hasten his execution.
If you can keep me here until after
his execution I will then—to save my life,
for my wife’s sake, for my children’s sake—keep
silence. And may God forgive me
for a compromiser and a coward!” he added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
with a groan. “But if, before that, I can
make my escape; if, before that, I can in
any way communicate with the outside world,
I will denounce you, at any cost to myself.”</p>

<p>The Judge would have spoken, but Jeff
held up his hand. “Wait! I have listened
to you—listen now to me. You have forgotten
that there are two sides to every bargain.
You sit directly between me and Mac,
your hands are upon the table, your feet are
beneath the table, the typewriter is at my
hand. Do not move! If Mac stirs but an
inch, if you dare raise a finger, until you have
agreed to my proposition, by the God that
made me, I will crush your skull like an
egg!”</p>

<p>“Had ye wrung his neck off-hand, as I
urgit upon ye frae the first——” The
words came bitterly from Mac, sitting rigid
in his corner—“this wadna have chancit.”
His tones conveyed a singular mixture of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
melancholy and triumph; the thickening of
his Scotch burr betrayed his agitation. “Be
guidit by me noo at the last, Judge, and tak
the daft body’s terms. In my opeenion the
project of smashin’ your head wi’ the machine
is enteerly pract’ecable, and I think
Mr. Bransford will e’en do it. Why should
he no? A dead man has naught to fear.
My gude word is, mak treaty wi’ him and
save your——”</p>

<p>“Neck. For this time,” hinted Jeff delicately.</p>

<p>The Judge did not shrink, he did not pale;
but neither did he move. “And your presentiment
that you would see me hanged?
You have abandoned that, it seems?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, not at all,” said Jeff, cheerily.
“You are going to do just what I propose.
You’d rather take the chance of having your
neck broken legally than the certainty that
I’ll break it now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“With that thing? Humph! You
couldn’t hurt me much with that. I think
I could get up and away before you could
hit me with it. And Mac would certainly
shoot you before you could hit me a second
time.”</p>

<p>“Once will be a-plenty.” Bransford
laughed. “You go first, I beseech you, my
dear Alphonse! O no, Judge—you don’t
think anything of the kind. If you did
you’d try it. Your legs—limbs, I mean of
course—are too far under the table. And
I’ve been practising for speed with this machine
every day. What Mac does to me
afterward won’t help you any. You’ll be
done dead, damned and delivered. If he
could shoot me now without shooting through
you, it would be a different proposition.
Your mistake was in ever letting me line
you up. ‘Tit, tat, toe—Three in a row!’
Well, what are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“Oh, man, ye chargit me streectly to keep
this wild cat-a-mountain at his distance,” interrupted
Mac in mournful reproach, “and
then pop ye down cheek by jowl wi’ the
deil’s buckie your ainsel’. I’d as lief seat
me to sup wi’ the black devil and his muckle
pitchfork!”</p>

<p>As often happens in such cases, the man
who was in no immediate danger was more
agitated than the one imperiled; who, after
a moment’s reflection, looked up at Bransford
with a smile in his eyes.</p>

<p>“And how am I to know you will not denounce
me if I let you go after this unfortunate
Tillotson is hanged?” he demanded.
“Or, for that matter, how are you to know
that I will not kill you as soon as I am beyond
the reach of your extremely novel
weapon—which, I grant you, might be effective
at such close quarters and in such capable
hands—or that I will not have you killed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
at any time hereafter? This,” said the
Judge, picking his words leisurely and contemplating
his fine fingers with unreserved
approval, “is the crux of the very interesting
situation. Rigid moralists, scrutinizing the
varied actions of my life, might find passages
not altogether blameless. But I have always
held and maintained that a man should keep
faith where it is expressly pledged. This is
the bedrock upon which is based all relations
of man with man, and to no class is it so
needful as to those who are at variance with
society. If a man will not hold by his
plighted word, even to his hurt, he has lost all
contact with reality and is become henceforth
no actuality, but a vain and empty simulacrum,
not to be dealt with, useless either for
good or evil. Here, for instance, are we,
two intelligent men, confronting mutual instant
annihilation; which might be avoided
could each be perfectly sure the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
would keep his word! It is quite amusing!”</p>

<p>“I will take your word if you will take
mine,” said Jeff. “You should know who
runs the greater risk. But I have a stipulation
to make.”</p>

<p>The Judge arched his brows. “A stipulation?
Another? My volatile and resourceful
friend, do not ask too much. It is by no
means certain that your extraordinary missile—or
was it to be a war-club?—might not fail
of the desired effect. You have already stipulated
for your life, and I think,” said the
Judge dryly, “that if you have any other
demand to make, it had best be a modest one.”</p>

<p>“I do not choose,” said Jeff steadily, “that
my wife shall suffer needless anxiety—unneeded
if you set me free at last. Still less
do I choose, if I meet with foul play at your
hands, or if I should be killed attempting
an escape, to have her haunted by any doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
of me. I shall write to her that I am in
Old Mexico, in some part known to be dangerous,
tempted by high pay. You will send
it to be mailed down there. Then, if I do
not come back, she will think of me as honorably
dead, and be at peace.”</p>

<p>It came into the Judge’s active mind that
such a letter—dated and signed from some
far-off Mexican town—might, in some contingencies,
be useful to him; his bold, blue
eyes, which had faced an imminent death
firmly enough, dropped now to hide the
treacherous thought. And upon this thought,
and its influence upon sending the letter, Jeff
had counted from the first.</p>

<p>“There are other reasons,” said Jeff.
“You have been pleased to speak well of me.
You have boasted, both for yourself and for
me, enough and more than enough. Let me
now boast for myself. Has it never occurred
to you that such a man as I am would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
friends—formidable friends? That they are
wondering what has become of me? If you
agree to my arrangement, I have a chance
of saving both my life and some shreds of
decency. I do not now want my friends to
come in search of me and get me killed in
trying to rescue me—for you will, of course,
redouble your precautions after this. This
letter will put my friends at ease. I will have
to trust you to mail it. That is the weakness
of my position. But I will think that there
is a chance that you will mail it—and that
chance will help me to keep a quiet mind.
That much, at least, will be a clear gain. Do
this, and I will yield a point to you. If you
would rather I didn’t, I will not go to see
you hanged!”</p>

<p>The amazing effrontery of this last coaxing
touch so appealed to Judge Thorpe’s sense of
humor that he quite recovered his good nature.
“My dear boy,” he said, “if I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
ever be hanged, I wouldn’t miss having you
there for worlds. It would add a zest to the
occasion that I should grieve to lose. I will
agree unconditionally to your proposed <i>modus
vivendi</i>. As I understand it, if I can hang
Tillotson you are to keep silence and go free.
But if you can contrive to get me hanged you
are to attend the festivity in person? It is
a wager. Write your letter and I’ll mail it.
Of course, I’ll have to read it and edit it if
needed. And say—Bransford! I’ll mail it,
too! You can be at rest on that point. In
the meantime, I presume, I may move without
bringing the typewriter about my ears?”</p>

<p>“You may,” said Jeff. “It’s a bet. I
wish you’d wait and I’ll write the letter now.
She’ll be anxious about me. It’ll take some
time. I always write her long letters. Let
me have your fountain-pen, will you?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you use your typewriter?”
said the Judge. “And, by the way, I fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
we shall have to deprive you of your typewriter
in the future.”</p>

<p>“A typewritten letter wouldn’t be consistent
at all,” said Jeff. “I am supposed to be
writing from darkest Old Mexico. No typewriters
there. Besides, I can’t write with
the damn thing to do any good. Say, don’t
take it away from me, Judge; there’s a good
fellow. I want to master it. I do hate to be
beaten.”</p>

<p>“The elasticity with which you adjust
yourself to changing conditions is beyond all
praise,” said the Judge, smiling. “Like the
other Judge, in the Bible, I yield to importunity.
I can deny you nothing. Keep your
typewriter, then, with the express understanding
that its use as a deadly weapon is
barred. Here’s the pen.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JEFF pulled the paper over and began to
scribble madly; pausing from time to
time to glance around for inspiration: at the
Judge, at Mac, at the papers, the books, the
typewriter. “I’ll slip in a note for the kids,”
said Jeff. His lips moved, his eyes kindled
in his eager absorption; his face took on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
softer and tenderer look. The Judge, watching
him, beamed with almost paternal indulgence.</p>

<p>On the whole Jeff wrote with amazing
swiftness for a man who professed to be
unaccustomed to lying. For this communication,
apparently so spontaneous, dashed off
by a man hardly yet clear of the shadow of
death, was learned by rote, no syllable unpremeditated,
the very blots of it designed.</p>

<p>This is what he handed the Judge at last:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Miguel</span>, Chihuahua, March 24.</p>

<p><i>My dear Wife</i>:</p>

<p>Since I last wrote you I have been on a
long trip into the Yaqui country as guide,
interpreter and friend to a timid tenderfoot—and
all-round sharp from the Smithsonian.
His main lay is Cliff-Dweller-ology, but
he does other stunts—rocks and bugs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
and Indian languages, and early Spanish
relics.</p>

<p>I get big pay. I enclose you $100——</p>
</div>

<p>“A hundred dollars! Why, this is blackmail!”
remonstrated the Judge, grinning
nevertheless.</p>

<p>“But,” said Jeff, “I’ve got to send it.
She knows I wouldn’t stay away except for
good big pay, and she knows I’ll send the
big pay to her. I didn’t think you were a
piker. Why, I had thirty dollars in my
pocket. You won’t be out but seventy.
And if you don’t send it she’ll know
the letter is a fake. Besides, she needs
the money.”</p>

<p>“I surrender! I’ll send it,” said the
Judge, and resumed his reading:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>——and will send you more when I get
back from next trip. Going way down in
the Sierra Madre this time. Don’t know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
when we will hit civilization again, so you
needn’t write till you hear from me.</p>

<p>The Cliff-Dweller-ologist had the El
Paso papers sent on here to him and I am
reading them all through while he writes
letters and reports and things. I am reading
some of his books, too.</p>

<p>Mary, I always hated it because I didn’t
have a better education. I used to wonder
if you wasn’t sometimes ashamed of me when
we was first married. But I’ve learned a
heap from you and I’ve picked up considerable,
reading, these last few years—and I
begin to see that there are compensations in
all things. I see a good deal in things I read
now that I would have missed if I’d just
skimmed over the surface when I was younger.
For instance, I’ve just made the acquaintance
of Julius Cæsar—introduced by my chief.</p>

<p>Say, that’s a great book! And I just
know I’m getting more out of it than if I’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
been familiar with it ever since I was a boy,
with stone-bruises on my hoofs. I’ve read
it over two or three times now, and find
things every time that I didn’t quite get
before.</p>

<p>It ought to be called Yond Caius Cassius,
though. Shakspere makes Julius out to be
a superstitious old wretch. But Julius had
some pretty good hunches at that.</p>

<p>Of course Mark Antony’s wonderful speech
at the funeral was fine business. Gee! how
he skinned the “Honorable men!” Some
of the things he said after that will stand
reading, too.</p>

<p>But Yond Cassius, he was the man for my
money. He was a regular go-getter. If
Brutus had only hearkened to Cassius once
in a while they’d have made a different play
of it. I didn’t like Brutus near so well. He
was a four-flusher. Said he wouldn’t kill
himself and sure enough he did. He was set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
up and heady and touchy. I shouldn’t wonder
if he was better than Cassius, just morally.
I guess maybe that’s why Cassius
knuckled down to him and humored him so.
But intellectually, and as a man of action,
he wasn’t ace-high to Cassius.</p>

<p>Still there’s no denying that Brutus had a
fine line of talk. There was his farewell to
Cassius—you remember that—and his parting
with his other friends.</p>

<p>I’ve been reading Carlyle’s “French Revolution”
too. It’s a little too deep for me,
so I take it in small doses. It looks to me
like a great writer could take a page of it
and build a book on it.</p>

<p>Well, that’s all I know. Oh, yes! I tried
to learn typewriting when I was in El Paso—I
musn’t forget that. I made up a sentence
with all the letters in it—he kept vexing
me by frantic journeys hidden with quiet zeal—I
got so I could rattle that off pretty well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
but when I tried new stuff I got balled
up.</p>

<p>Will write you when I can. George will
know what to do with the work. Have the
boys help him.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your loving husband,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Jeff</span>.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Dear Kids</i>:</p>

<p>I wish you could see some of the places
I saw in the mountains. We took the train
to Casas Grandes and went with a pack outfit
to Durasno and Tarachi, just over the
line into Sonora. That’s one fine country.
Had a good time going and coming, but
when we got there and my chief was snooping
around in those musty old underground
cave houses I was bored a-plenty. One day
I remember I lay in camp with nothing to do
and read every line of an old El Paso paper,
ads and all.</p>

<p>Leo, you’re getting to be a big boy now.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
I want you to get into something better than
punching cows. When you get time you
ought to go down to your Uncle Sim’s and
make a start on learning to use a typewriter.
I’ve been trying it myself, but it’s hard for
an old dog to learn new tricks.</p>

<p>You and Wesley must both help your
mother, and help George. Do what George
tells you—he knows more about things than
you do. Be good kids. I’ll be home just
as soon as I can.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Dad.</span></p>
</div>

<p>“There,” said Jeff, “if there’s anything
you want to blue-pencil I’ll write it over.
Anything you want to say suits me so long
as it goes.”</p>

<p>“Why, this seems all right,” said the
Judge, after reading it. “I have an envelope
in my billbook. Address it, but don’t
seal it. You might attempt to put in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
inclosure by sleight-of-hand. If you try any
such trick I shall consider myself absolved
from any promise. If you don’t, I’ll mail
it. I always prefer not to lie when I have
nothing to gain by lying. Bless my soul,
how you have blotted it!”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m getting nervous,” said Jeff.</p>

<p>The envelope bore the address:</p>

<p class="center">
MRS. JEFF BRANSFORD,<br>
Rainbow South,<br>
<span class="indentleft">Escondido, N. M.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="indentright">c/o <span class="smcap">William Beebe</span>.</span></p>

<p>“Of course you will do as you like,”
remonstrated Patterson, later. “But I
shouldn’t send that letter, and I should, without
any further delay, erase Mr. Bransford’s
name from the list of living men.”</p>

<p>“Tush!” said the Judge. “The letter is
harmless. The man is a splendid fighter, and
has some practical notion of psychology, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
the poor fellow has no imagination. In his
eagerness, he made his letter up on the spur
of the moment. There is scarcely a line in
it but was suggested by his surroundings.
His haste and affection made him transparent;
I followed the workings of his mind and,
except for personalities, anticipated practically
all of it.</p>

<p>“As for killing him, I shall do nothing
of the kind. I made a bargain with him in
the very article of death and I shall keep
to it. He cannot escape; it is not possible.
Besides, I like the man. Hang it, Patterson,
he is what I would wish my son to be, if I
had one. I’ll not kill him and I’ll send his
letter.”</p>

<p>He did send it. It reached Billy Beebe
some days later, to his no small mystification—Jeff
Bransford was unmarried. Yet
the address was indubitably in Jeff’s handwriting.
Taking Leo Ballinger into consultation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
he carried it unopened to John Wesley
Pringle; taking also a letter for that person,
bearing an El Paso postmark many days
earlier than the one for the mysterious Mrs.
Bransford. Both had lain long in the Escondido
office before any one passed going
to Rainbow, so the two letters reached there
together.</p>

<p>Pringle’s letter was brief:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">El Paso</span>, Texas, March 20.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. John Wesley Pringle</span>,<br>
<span class="indentleft2">Rainbow, N. M.</span></p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>:</p>

<p>Your friend, Mr. Jeff Bransford, came here
some time since on some business with Mr.
Simon Hibler—whose clerk I am. Mr.
Hibler was on a trip to San Simon, Arizona,
and I did not know exactly when he would
return. Mr. Bransford decided to wait for
him. We became great friends and he rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
made his headquarters with me. He told me
a great deal about you.</p>

<p>On the night of March 16th, Mr. Bransford
was with me until almost midnight,
when he started for his rooms. So far as
I can learn he has not been seen or heard
of since; his effects are still at his lodgings.
He did not take the street car home. I inquired
carefully of all the men.</p>

<p>It is now the fourth day since his disappearance
and I am much distressed. I
have lodged information with the police—but,
between you and me, I don’t feel any
enthusiasm about the police.</p>

<p>If you have any knowledge of his whereabouts
I wish you would be so kind as to
drop me a line. If you know nothing, I
hope that you and the other friends he spoke
of so often would come down, and I will put
myself at your orders. I am uneasy. As you
doubtless know, this is one awful tough town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>Trusting to hear good news at an early
date, I remain,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright2">Yours truly,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Geo. T. Aughinbaugh</span>.</p>

<p>112 Temple Street.</p>
</div>

<p>On reading this John Wesley took it upon
himself to open the letter for the non-existent
Mrs. Bransford. From that cryptic
document they gathered three things only.
First, Jeff was under duress; his letter was
written to pass inspection by hostile eyes.
Second, Leo Ballinger was to visit Uncle
Sim and to learn typewriting. Third, George
would tell them what to do. There was no
George at Rainbow; Leo’s only uncle, Simon
Hibler, lived in El Paso, his clerk’s name
was George. The inference was plain.</p>

<p>The next day the three friends presented
themselves at 112 Temple Street.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<div class="verse">Each in his own opinion</div>
<div class="indent">Exceeding stiff and strong.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="drop-cap">SO singular an effect did Mrs. Bransford’s
letter have upon Mr. George Aughinbaugh
that he went red and white by turns,
and became incoherent in excited endeavor to
say a number of different things at one and
the same time; so that Mr. John Wesley
Pringle was moved to break off in his reading,
to push Mr. Aughinbaugh into a chair, and
to administer first aid to the distracted from
a leather-covered bottle.</p>

<p>“Take a sip o’ this. One swallow will
make you simmer,” he said earnestly. “Old
Doctor Pringle’s Priceless Prescription, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
sovereign remedy for rattlesnake bites, burns,
boils, sprains and bruises, fits, freckles and
housemaid’s sore knee; excellent for chilblains,
sunburn, congestion of the currency,
inflammation of the ego, corns, verbosity,
insomnia, sleeplessness, lying awake and bad
dreams, punctuality, fracture of the Decalogue,
forgetfulness, painful memory, congenital
pip, the pangs of requited affection,
mange, vivacity, rush of words to the head,
old age and lockjaw.</p>

<p>“I know that Jeff is in one big difficulty,
and I see that you understand what his letter
means, which is more than I do. Speak up!
Say, state and declare what lies heavy on
your mind. Tell us about it. If you can’t
talk make signs.”</p>

<p>Neither this speech nor the restorative
served wholly to dispel Aughinbaugh’s bewilderment.
He looked at Mr. Pringle in
foggy confusion, holding fast to the panacea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
as if that were the one point on which he
was quite clear. Seeing which, Mr. Pringle,
somewhat exasperated, renewed his eulogy
with increased energy and eloquence. “It is
also much used in cases of total depravity,
contributory negligence, propinquities, clergyman’s
sore throat, equilateral strangulation
and collar galls, veracity, pessimism, Scylla
and Charybdis, stuttering, processions of
equine oxen and similar phenomena, insubordination,
altitude, consanguinity, chalcedony,
irritation of the Ephemeridæ, symmetry,
vocalization, mammalia, clairvoyance, inertia,
acrimony, persecution, paresis, paraphernalia,
perspective, perspiration, tyranny, architecture
and entire absence of mind—take another
dose!” He cast an appealing glance around.
“I can’t get at what Jeff’s trying to say,”
declared Mr. Pringle with some asperity, “but
if I could, I’m damned if I couldn’t tell it!
Speak up! Play it out on the typewriter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Acting upon this hint, Aughinbaugh turned
to the typewriter and clattered furiously on
the keys. He took off two sheets and spread
them on the table, face to face, so that one
sheet covered all of the other but the first
two lines. “There!” he said, pointing.
Beebe read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘<i>Now is the time for all good men and true to come to the aid of the party.</i><br>

<i>A quick move by the enemy will jeopardize six fine gunboats.</i>’”</p>
</div>

<p>“He spoke twice—once in each letter,”
said George Aughinbaugh, “of learning to use
the typewriter. He gave a speed sentence
that he had made up, containing the entire
alphabet. These are similar sentences, used
by nearly every one who learns to typewrite.
Jeff was familiar with them. He practised
the first one by the hour. I gave him the
second one the last night he was here. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
is calling on us to come to his help; he is
warning us to be careful, that one unconsidered
move on our part, ‘a quick move,’
will be dangerous to him. Taken in connection
with the other allusions in his letter, and
to things that I know outside of his letter,
it probably means that such a quick move
might be fatal to him. He is imprisoned—not
legally; secretly—and in great danger.
Of course, parts of his letter are only padding
to introduce and join plausibly the vital allusions
so that his captors would allow the
letter to go. The allusions are not consecutive.
When he speaks of——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, old man; you’re getting all
balled up again,” said Pringle. “Suppose,
first of all, you tell us, as clearly as you can,
exactly what you understand him to mean,
just as if he had written it to you direct,
without any parables. Then you can explain
to us how you got at it, afterwards.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>George walked the room, rearranged his
thoughts and, in the process, mastered his
agitation.</p>

<p>Finally he faced the three friends and said:
“He is in prison, in Juarez, the victim of
a conspiracy. He is in utmost danger; he
is closely guarded; the persons involved have
such powerful reasons for holding him that
they would kill him rather than allow him
to be rescued. What we do must be done
with the greatest caution; his guards must
not have the slightest suspicion that a rescue
is attempted, or planned, or possible, till it is
carried out. In addition to this he tells us
that we are to communicate with him by means
of the personal columns of the El Paso
papers——”</p>

<p>“I got that,” said Pringle, “but that is
about all I did get. Of course, we all figured
it out that we were to come to you for
instructions, and that there was something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
about a typewriter we wanted to look into.
That was plain enough. There, I’m talking
with my mouth. Go on!”</p>

<p>“And, in his great danger and distress,
he sends you—to Mr. Pringle first, and then
to all of you—a last and tenderest farewell,
and the strong assurance of his faith that you
will do for him all that men can do.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” exclaimed Leo. “And
was there no hint of who it was that had
done this?”</p>

<p>“There was!” said Aughinbaugh, with
sparkling eyes. “It was two well-known,
wealthy and influential El Paso men—the
Honorable S. S. Thorpe and Sam Patterson.”</p>

<p>“Show me!” said Pringle—“though I begin
to see.”</p>

<p>“Half the letter is taken up by comment
on the play of Julius Cæsar, which he and
I had been reading together,” said George.
“He tells us plainly, over and over, in different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
words, to look in it for meanings beneath
the surface. You remember that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, the play hinges upon the conspiracy
of Brutus and Cassius—a conspiracy carried
out on the Ides of March. Look!”
He moved the paper to expose another line:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Remember March, the Ides of March remember!</i></p>
</div>

<p>“Not till then did I remember that the
sixteenth of March, the day on which Jeff
disappeared, was—not indeed the Ides of
March, the fifteenth, but devilish close to it,
close enough. So what he says is: ‘George,
remember—think carefully—remember exactly
what took place the day you saw me
last.’</p>

<p>“He left my rooms just before midnight.
And at midnight exactly, as sworn to by many
people, at a spot about a mile from here—at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> 
a spot which Jeff might have reached at
just that time—something happened: a street
fight in which two men were killed, and the
survivor, Captain Charles Tillotson, was
wounded. Have you, by any chance, read the
evidence in the Tillotson case?”</p>

<p>“Every word of it,” said Billy. “We
read the full account of the trial at Escondido
yesterday, while we were waiting for the
train.”</p>

<p>“Good! Good! That simplifies matters.
Think closely—keep in your minds the evidence
given at that trial—while I follow
Jeff up after he left my door. He must have
gone somewhere, you know—and he said he
was going home. He usually took the car,
but I have already told you that he didn’t
that night.</p>

<p>“Now, my rooms are two blocks north of
the street-car line; Jeff’s were three blocks
south, and a long way up toward town. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
corner of Colorado and Franklin, where the
fight took place, was on one of the several
routes he might have taken. And, if he had
chosen that particular way, he would have
reached the scene of the shooting precisely in
time to get mixed up in it. I ought, by all
means, to have thought of that before, but I
didn’t—till my wits were sharpened trying to
make out Jeff’s letter.</p>

<p>“Tillotson, you remember, claims that
Krouse shot him without cause or warning;
that he, himself, only fired in self-defense;
that a fourth man killed Broderick—a fourth
man who mysteriously disappeared, as Jeff
did.</p>

<p>“Thorpe and Patterson, on the contrary,
swore that Tillotson made the attack, not
upon Krouse but upon Broderick. Few have
ever doubted that evidence, because it was
not likely that a man of Broderick’s known
and deadly quickness could be shot twice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
without firing a shot himself, except by a
man who took him by surprise.</p>

<p>“But, if Tillotson tells the truth, Thorpe
and Patterson lied; and there is a conspiracy
for you. And if Tillotson tells the truth, a
fourth man did kill Broderick—who more
likely than Jeff Bransford, who disappeared,
due at that time and place?”</p>

<p>“You mean, possibly due at that time and
place,” interrupted Billy. “And how do you
account for Jeff’s taking Broderick at a disadvantage?
It seems to me you are giving
him a poor character.”</p>

<p>“Possibly due at that time and place,”
corrected Aughinbaugh, “but certainly disappeared—like
Tillotson’s fourth man. As
to taking Broderick unawares—wait till you
hear Jeff’s story. I can suggest one solution,
however—which holds only if there was a
conspiracy to murder Tillotson, which, failing,
took the turn of hanging him instead.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
Assassins in ambush are not entitled to the
usual courtesies. If Jeff happened along and
observed an ambuscade, he would be likely
to waive ceremony.”</p>

<p>“But Thorpe and Patterson have good
characters, haven’t they?” asked Pringle.</p>

<p>“Good reputations,” said George tartly.
“Though it is whispered that Thorpe, as a
young man, was habitually careless with firearms.
But Tillotson also bore an excellent
reputation, minus the whispering. It is at
least half as probable that two men of good
repute should turn perjurers over-night, as
that one should. Broderick had a very bad
reputation and Krouse had no reputation at
all. In fact, that is the only reason a few
cling to their belief in Tillotson’s innocence.
No motive or reason of any kind is assigned
for Tillotson’s unprovoked attack upon
Krouse, as alleged. But the enmity of
Thorpe and Tillotson was of common knowledge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
It is also rumored that both had been
paying marked attention to the same lady.
Here are two possible motives for a conspiracy:
hatred and jealousy. Of the two
dead men, Broderick was a led captain, a
bravo, a proven tool for any man who had
a handle to him; the other man was unknown.”</p>

<p>“The cab driver told the same story,”
said Pringle. “Was he an enemy of Tillotson?”</p>

<p>“He did,” agreed George. “He also ran
away. When he came back, the next day,
he accounted for himself by saying that he
was scared. That sounds queer to me.
Timid people may drive cabs, but timid people
do not drive cabs in El Paso. The life is too
hilarious. But, if he wasn’t scared, why did
he run away? But again, Jeff Bransford
wouldn’t get scared——”</p>

<p>“You’re all wrong there,” said Pringle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
“Me—I’ve been scared stiff, lots of times.
And anyhow—how could any fourth man
get away? The neighborhood turned out
at once—and they didn’t see him.”</p>

<p>“Jeff Bransford wouldn’t be scared enough
to run away, nor you either,” amended
George. “If you did that, you wouldn’t
want anybody to believe you under oath.
Come back now. How did the fourth man
get away, if he was Jeff Bransford and
wouldn’t run away, no matter what he had
done? To figure it out, suppose you knew
it was Jeff, but didn’t know how he got
away—you see? He went in that cab! If
the driver was really so timid, why did he
ever come back to mix in the trouble of a
murder trial? To help hang Tillotson. And
his evidence was needed because Thorpe and
Patterson were known foes to Tillotson—while
he was not.</p>

<p>“If they lied, if the whole thing was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
put-up job, if they carried Jeff off in the cab,
probably wounded——”</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” said Leo, “that there are
a fatal number of ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ in your
theory. Given a series of four even chances,
each of which you are to win, and each of
which, to count for you, is contingent upon
your winning each of the other three, and
your chances are not one in eight but one
in two hundred and fifty-six.”</p>

<p>“This is not a game of dice, Mr. Ballinger,”
retorted Aughinbaugh. “This letter
is not the result of chance, but purposed
and planned by an unusual man—who had
ten days in which to study it out. I have only
touched on a few of his significant allusions
and stopped to put forward the complete
theory based on them all. If you will be
patient I will now show you how he unmistakably
denounces these men.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said Billy, “but I have to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
acknowledge that I agree with Leo. A theory
based upon too many probabilities becomes
improbable for that very reason. Too
many ‘ifs’!”</p>

<p>“There is no ‘if’ about Jeff’s disappearance,”
rejoined George hotly. “That we
know. There is no ‘if’ about this letter,
written in his own hand long after, written
to a non-existent wife, in care of Billy Beebe;
written under no conceivable conditions and
for no conceivable purpose except to convey
information under the very eyes of a vigilant
jailer; a wanton and senseless folly, that could
serve no purpose but to stir us to cruel and
useless alarm, if it does not carry to us this
information. When two hundred and fifty-six
grossly improbable things point each to a
common center, the grossness of each separate
improbability makes the designed pointing
just so much more convincing. You won’t
let me go on. By Heavens, we are discussing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
the laws of evidence and lower mathematics,
instead of deciphering this letter!”</p>

<p>“Let Mr. Aughinbaugh be!” said Pringle.
“Jeff said, once and again, that George would
tell us what to do. We know two very
significant truths, and only two: Jeff left Mr.
Aughinbaugh’s rooms a few minutes before
midnight. He should have reached his own
rooms just after midnight; he didn’t. There
are the contradicting events, apparently giving
each other the lie; there, and not at another
time. If Thorpe and his striker lied—and
men do lie, even politicians—Jeff is accounted
for. And it is the weakness of a lie that it
is no real thing, but an appearance botched
upon the very truth. When in doubt, search
for the joint. The lie is compressed by hard
facts into these few minutes. George is looking
in the right place, George knows what
to do; go on, George! That will be all from
the Great Objectors.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">SO George went on: “As Mr. Pringle says,
the fact of Jeff’s disappearance at this
exact time and possible place strengthened
all of the otherwise far-fetched ‘ifs’ twenty-fold.
For that reason I stopped any translation
of Jeff’s letter, though I had barely
begun it, to state in full my theory, or rather
my hypothesis, based on the remarkable conjunction
of a hinted conspiracy, the occasion
and motive of a conspiracy, and what was in
all likelihood the consummation of that conspiracy,
with both Jeff and Tillotson as
victims.</p>

<p>“We will now take up the consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
of the letter. See if it does not reinforce
my hypothesis on every point, until, as
block after block falls inevitably into place,
ordered and measured, it becomes a demonstration.</p>

<p>“To begin with, the reference to the
‘French Revolution’ is to the paragraph
that I finished reading to him a few minutes
before he left me, telling of a man secretly
and falsely imprisoned in the Bastille by a
<i>lettre de cachet</i>, a letter of hiding, procured
by some powerful personage; a man whose
one vain thought and hope and prayer was to
have some word of his wife—of his dear wife.
And there, I have no doubt, is where Jeff
got the idea for this dear, sudden wife of his.
Shall I read the paragraph for you?”</p>

<p>He should; and did.</p>

<p>“And from that paragraph—as I told
Jeff in the very last words I spoke to him—Dickens
got the inspiration for his novel, ‘A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Tale of Two Cities.’ What did Jeff say?
In effect, that a great writer could find material
for a novel from any page. ‘A Tale
of Two Cities!’ And here are the two cities,
El Paso and Juarez, side by side—as closely
associated as Sodom and Gomorrah, of which,
indeed, they remind me at times. Could he,
under the circumstances, say any plainer: ‘I
am in Juarez, in a strong and secret prison’?”</p>

<p>“That seems likely enough,” admitted Leo
grudgingly.</p>

<p>“It is plain,” said Billy. “It is there;
it must mean something; it means that.”</p>

<p>“Keep that in mind, then, and consider
all the other hints in the light of that admitted
message. Weigh them and their probable
meaning in connection with this plain
warning.</p>

<p>“He speaks of Antony’s great oration.
He actually quotes two words of it: ‘Honorable
men!’ Therefore, it was important;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
he wished to put unusual emphasis on it.
Three other important things were called to
our attention by being mentioned twice: one
vital point, which I will take up later—in fact,
the last of all—was distinctly referred to no
less than four times. But this is the only
direct quotation in the letter.</p>

<p>“Yet of all the words in the play, these
two are precisely the two that least need
quoting to bring them to remembrance. No
one who has read Antony’s speech will ever
forget them. Jeff had no need to reiterate
here; Antony has done it for him. They
were the very heart and blood of it; the master
of magic freighted those two words, in
their successive differing expression, with
praise, uncertainty, doubt, suspicion, invective,
certainty, hate, fury, denunciation and revenge.
‘Honorable men!’ And Thorpe,
too, is an honorable man! The Honorable
S. S. Thorpe! Is that chance?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“More yet! Jeff went out of the way to
drag in the wholly superfluous statement that
Antony said some things after that which
would bear reading. As a literary criticism
this is beneath contempt. The words of Antony,
as reported by William Shakspere,
would be all that without the seal of his approval.
But let us see! He says ‘after’
Cæsar’s funeral oration. Look at the words,
Mr. Ballinger. Do you observe anything unusual?”</p>

<p>“I see a blot,” said Leo.</p>

<p>“You see a blot—and you speak of it,
unhesitatingly, as unusual. Why? Because
Jeff was a man of scrupulous neatness, over-particular,
old-maidish. If that blot had been
made by accident he would have written the
page over again. It was made purposely.
And so anxious was he that we should not
overlook it, that he has fairly sprinkled the
blank half-page below his signature with blots,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
trusting that we would then notice and study
out the other one. Let us do it. ‘After’
the funeral oration, he said—but wait. You
look, Mr. Beebe; look closely. Do you see
anything else there? Pass your finger over
it.”</p>

<p>“I see and feel where he has twice thrust
the pen through the paper,” said Billy, changing
color. “And I begin to see, and feel,
and believe.”</p>

<p>“You mean, doubtless, that you begin to
believe and tremble,” said George spitefully.
“Now we will find what Antony says ‘after’
the oration, so well worth looking into. Gentlemen,
the first words Shakspere puts into
Antony’s mouth after the funeral scene
are these—and remember it is where the
Triumvirs are proscribing senators to
death, and that Thorpe was formerly a
senator, if only a state senator—hear Mark
Antony:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“‘<i>These many, then, shall die; their names
are prick’d.</i>’”</p>

<p>“Pricked!” echoed George triumphantly.
“He has denounced them—two of them—the
two we know! Thorpe and Patterson. But
perhaps that is a gross improbability—a mere
coincidence. If anything is lacking to make
the denunciation complete, terrible and compelling,
it is now supplied. The next words
Antony speaks——”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Pringle, eying
Beebe. “Let’s see if Billy can carry on your
argument. Can you, Billy?”</p>

<p>Billy put a shaky finger on the blot. His
voice was hoarse with passion.</p>

<p class="center">“‘<i>He shall not live; look, with a spot I
damn him!</i>’”</p>

<p>“He shall not live,” repeated Pringle,
“this honorable senator—not if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
I have to strangle him with my bare
hands!”</p>

<p>“I—I suppose you are right,” gasped Leo,
aghast. “But, suffering saints, he must think
we are remarkable men to study out anything
so obscure as all that. Why, there isn’t one
chance in a million for it!”</p>

<p>“Well—so we all are, just that kind of
men,” said George modestly, “even if some
of us are chiefly remarkable for incredulity
and—firmness. Obscure? Why, dear man,
it had to be obscure! If it hadn’t been obscure
it would never have been allowed to
reach us—I mean, of course, to reach Mrs.
Bransford. And yet, in a way, it was neither
so obscure nor so remarkable. In the first
place, this is not a case of solving puzzles,
with a nickel-plated Barlow knife for a prize,
or a book for good little girls. This letter
means something; it is the urgent call of a
friend in need; we are friends indeed, grown-up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> 
men, and it is our business to find out
what it means. We have to find out; a man’s
life is the prize—and more than that, as it
turns out. He sent you to me as interpreter,
not because he wanted Mr. Pringle to take
orders from me, but for the one only reason
that it was not obscure to me, and that he
knew it would not be obscure to me. Do you
notice that I did not have to turn to the play
to verify the quotations? It is fresh in my
mind and in his: we read it aloud together,
we spouted it at each other, we used phrases
of it instead of words to carry on ordinary
conversation. Mr. Beebe here, when once he
was on the right track, could supply the words
for the most difficult of all the allusions,
though he had probably not read the book
for years.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t never read this Mr. Shakspere
much, myself,” said Pringle meditatively.
“But oncet—’twas the first time I was ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
in love—I read all that stuff of Tennyson’s
about King Arthur’s ‘Ten Knights in a Bar
Room,’ and I want to tell you that I couldn’t
even think of anything else for a month.
So it seems mighty natural that Jeff, with his
head full of this Shakspere party, would try
that particular way of getting word to us,
and no other. You spoke of a message for
me, Mr. Aughinbaugh?”</p>

<p>“I did. Of a message sent in the knowledge
that for all your daring, for all your
devotedness, you may not be able to avert
the threatened danger. In his desperate pass
he sends to you, as if he spoke with you face
to face for the last time, the words of Brutus
to his friend:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘<i>Therefore, our everlasting farewell take:</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>If not, why then, this parting was well made.</i>’”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>Silence fell upon them. Pringle went to
the window and stood looking out at the
night; the clock ticked loudly. Aughinbaugh,
keeping his eyes on the blurred typewritten
lines, went on:</p>

<p>“And the other message, of hope, and
confidence, and trust, is this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘<i>My heart doth joy that yet, in all my life,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>I found no man but he was true to me.</i>’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“All of which adds force to his injunction
that when the society of good men and true
come to his aid, they shall be careful to make
no move so quick as to jeopardize Jeff.
Q.E.D.”</p>

<p>“Since the majority is plainly against me,
and also since I am convinced myself, I’ll give
up,” said Ballinger. “And the next thing
plainly is, what are we going to do—or who
are we going to do?”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“JEFF tells us that too,” said George.
“In both letters he speaks of the El
Paso papers. In the letter to ‘the kids’ he
says that he read every line of one of them.
Knowing what we do, it is easy to see that
they are brought in to him and that he expects
us to communicate with him by means
of personals worded for his eye alone. He
is looking for them now. As he is so certain
of seeing personals, it seems sure that the
papers are brought in regularly to him. You
know he said his Chief had all the El Paso
papers sent on. And since they allow him
this indulgence, it is probable and consistent
that they do not otherwise ill-treat him. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
suppose they are trying to extort a promise
of silence from him under threat of death.
But what I don’t see is why they didn’t kill
him right away.”</p>

<p>“I understand that well enough,” said
Pringle. “Jeff has talked ’em out of it!
And did he give any hint about what to do?”</p>

<p>“That is the thing I put off till the last,”
George responded. “It is the most ambiguous
of all the allusions. When he twice
spoke of Cassius as ‘Yond Cassius,’ when
he mentioned Cæsar’s superstitions, and afterward
said some of his hunches were pretty
good at that, he might have been referring
me to either ‘Yond Cassius has a lean and
hungry look’ or to the line immediately
above: ‘Let me have men about me that are
fat.’ I am reasonably sure that he meant
the last. Because he knew that we would
get this far—to the big question of what we
were going to do about it. We are clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
as to Thorpe’s guilt; but that isn’t going to
help Jeff—or Tillotson.</p>

<p>“Under the circumstances it would have
been imprudent for him to give his street
and number; they might not have liked
it——”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” said Leo, “don’t you see?
He tells us, in so many words: ‘That’s all I
know.’ He didn’t know just where he was.
It wasn’t likely that he would know.”</p>

<p>“So he does! I hadn’t seen through that
at all,” said George. “Thank you. That
makes it almost a certainty that he meant ‘the
men about him,’ his jailers, were fat. We
have to find his jail, and our best chance is
to find his jailers. To tell us to look for
‘lean and hungry’ men in this country of
hard-riding, thin, slim, slender, lean, lank,
scrawny men, would serve no purpose. But
fat men are scarce enough to be noticeable.
Besides, Patterson is a mere mountain of flesh;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Thorpe himself is not actually fat, but is
dangerously near it. He laid so much stress
on this, coming back to it four times, that he
must have meant it for a big, plain signpost
for our guidance. That settles it. He has
men about him that are fat. And we’d better
look for them. Mr. Pringle, will you take
the lines?”</p>

<p>“The head of the table is wherever Wes’
sits down, anyway,” remarked Beebe loyally.</p>

<p>“It is moved and seconded that Mr. John
Wesley Pringle be elected—er—Sole Electee
of the Most Ancient Society of Good Men
and True,” said Leo. “All in favor will
rise or remain seated. Contrary-minded are
not members and will kindly leave the room.
It is unanimously carried and so ordered.
Gentlemen, Mr. Pringle!”</p>

<p>“The Society will come to order,” said the
Sole Electee severely. “Some good man and
true will please state the object of the permanent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
session and, also, how and why and what
he proposes to do first.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better get some detectives to
work,” ventured Billy, “and join forces with
Tillotson’s lawyers?”</p>

<p>“No detectives,” said Pringle hastily and
decidedly. And “No lawyers,” echoed
George with equal decision, adding: “Please
excuse Mr. Pringle and myself from giving
the reasons for our respective vetoes. But
they are good ones.”</p>

<p>“Then we are to depend on our own resources
alone?” demanded Leo.</p>

<p>“Exactly. That’s the way the farmer in
the second reader got in his wheat. Let us
by all means have Fools for Clients and
Every Man His Own Detective; that’s what
makes the guilty quail,” said Pringle darkly.
“If we four can’t do the trick for love, no
man can do it for hire. And there will be
no defalcation or failure for fear, favor or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
funds or through any fatal half-heartedness.
We four friends for our friend unconditionally,
without regard for law or the profits,
man or devil, death, debt, disgrace or
damnation! To the last ditch—and then
some!”</p>

<p>Pringle reflected a little. “Gentlemen,”
he said, “we will put our little ad. in the
papers to-night, at once, <i>muy pronto</i> and <i>immediatamente</i>.
After which I should think a
good sleep would be the one first wise move.
We will then sally forth, or Sarah forth, in
pursuit of knowledge in general, both in El
Paso and in Juarez—vulgarly called Whereas—and,
more especially, knowledge of Messrs.
Thorpe and Patterson and all fat men with
whom they do consort. To avoid giving any
slightest ground for suspicion—which must
be avoided at all hazards—I will disguise
myself as a bald-headed, elderly cattleman
from Rainbow. Mr. Aughinbaugh——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Mister? George, you mean,” said that
person.</p>

<p>“George, then. George, you will masquerade
as a lawyer’s clerk. Billy, you’d
better buy a haircut and canvas leggings and
get yourself up as a reformed Easterner in
the act of backsliding. And you, Leo”—he
paused and regarded Ballinger doubtfully—“You,”
he said, and stopped again, with a
puzzled frown. The unhappy victim writhed
and twisted, thus held up to public scorn and
derision as neither fish, flesh, nor herring.</p>

<p>“I have it,” said the poor nondescript,
with a brave attempt at a smile. “I’ll buy
some clothes, some booze and a stack of blues—and
pass myself off for a Remittance Man.”</p>

<p>Pringle heaved a sigh of relief. “I hated
to name it to you,” he said. “Say, when
Jeff first rescued you, exhumed you, resuscitated
you, or whatever it was, he told me a
little quotation the first time you went out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
and left us. His explanation went some like
this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘<i>I traced my son through a street of

</div>

<p>“So, my boy, it’s back to the husks and
the hogs for yours. You are assigned to
cover the Street of Broken Windows. And
that’s a pretty big order—in El Paso.”</p>

<p>The next morning Jeff found what he had
been looking for these many days. In both
the <i>Times</i> and the <i>Herald</i> was an inconspicuous
personal in the modest retirement of
the advertising section, of obscure wording
and small type:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="drop-cap">BILLY took up his quarters at the leading
hotel and permeated both El Paso and
Juarez with much abandon. He wired Cleveland,
Ohio, for funds, and Cleveland responded
generously, sending him, without delay
or demur, a noble wad for the emergency.</p>

<p>George frequented the real-estate section
on legitimate, if trivial, pretexts connected
with Hibler’s business; demanding vacation
from that legal luminary on his arrival.
Pringle waxed talkative with visiting and
resident cowmen, among whom exists a
curious freemasonry, informal but highly
effective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>Moreover, Pringle disregarded his own explicit
instructions. Such cowmen as he knew
well—and trusted—began to infest Juarez.
Their mere orders—for he gave them no reasons—were
to watch either Thorpe or Patterson
if they visited the Mexican city; also
any obnoxiously fat men with whom they
should hold conference; and to report progress.</p>

<p>The four friends between them watched
Thorpe in all his doings, dogged his footsteps
by night and by day—passed him from
one to the other like the button in the game—with
such vigilance that at the end of the
week they had discovered no single thing to
their help.</p>

<p>Thorpe loitered through life in sybaritic
fashion; rose late, fared sumptuously; gave
a little time to the real-estate office in which
he was investing partner; more to political
conferences. In the afternoons he rode or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
motored; sometimes he dropped in to the
Fire Company’s bowling alley instead, combating
a certain tendency to corpulence.</p>

<p>For the rest there was dinner at his club;
bridge with a select coterie, or perhaps the
theater; occasionally, a social function. And
the day usually ended with a visit to the big
Turkish Baths on Franklin Street, another
precaution against fatness. Nothing could be
more open and aboveboard than this respectable
gentleman’s walk and auto.</p>

<p>Patterson’s doings were much the same,
save that he shunned the little entertainments
where the Judge shone with a warm and
mellow splendor, and ventured often into that
quarter of the town that was Leo’s particular
care, breaking rather more than his full quota
of windows. He made also a brief trip to
Silver City, on which occasion Pringle again
violated his own orders by sending red-headed
Joe Cowan, cowboy, of Organ, as an observer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
for the G. M. A. T.—to no benefit to the
society.</p>

<p>Patterson had gone to look over a mining
proposition for a client.</p>

<p>This unavailing search had one curious and
unexpected result. Noticing many people
closely, perforce, they observed that a surprising
number of these had done those things
that they really ought not to have done. Also,
they kept on doing them; confident that no
man saw them: so cunning were they. So
that Ballinger gloomily avowed his intention
of turning blackmailer, rather than again to
appeal to what he was pleased to term the
“unremitting kindness” of his family.</p>

<p>Only one thing had occurred so far which
the most besotted optimist could interpret
as even a possible confirmation of their suspicions.</p>

<p>One night, the fourth of their surveillance,
Judge Thorpe took a late street car for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
Juarez, foregoing the baths. When he
alighted from it, at Calle San Rafael, John
Wesley Pringle also left the car on the farther
side and walked smartly away.</p>

<p>Thorpe having turned eastward, Pringle
came back and trailed along far behind. He
dared not follow closely; if Thorpe’s suspicions
should be aroused it would go hard with
Jeff. He preferred to risk losing his man
rather than to risk the consequences of an
alarm.</p>

<p>And lose him he did. The Judge turned
to the left at Terrazas Street. Pringle was
just a little too far behind. He made haste
to come up, but when he reached the corner
the Judge was out of sight; nor could he
catch the trail again. And the Judge returned
to El Paso without being seen again.</p>

<p>Of the other labors of the four friends
during this weary time; of myriad casual
questions that came to naught; of unnumbered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
fat men traced, unsuspecting, to their
blameless homes; of hope deferred, disappointments,
fastings, vain vigils, and all their
acts—behold! are they not written in the
book of Lost Endeavor?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Meanwhile Jeff read many books, he practised
his typewriting, he baited Mac mercilessly,
he experimented with new dishes procured
by that trusty henchman; and day by
day he noted in the papers little personals:
“Understand situation perfectly that quick
move will jeopardize”; “Making haste
slowly to come to aid of party, whereabouts
unknown sit steady”; and others, variously
worded to report no progress, to extol the
difficult virtue of patience and to recommend
its practice—always with a fragment from
one of the catchword sentences for an identification
tag. One of them gave no news at
all. It read: “Pack my box with five dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
liquor jugs. Practise that for quick movement.
Lots of time.”</p>

<p>But as John Wesley sagely remarked, “It’s
a long worm that has no turning.” And as
he said again, “The end doesn’t come till
along towards the last.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been listening at doors—and behind
trees—and down chimneys—or you couldn’t have
known it!”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="indentleft3">—<i>Humpty-Dumpty.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT last, on a happy day, there came to the
Judge’s office, demanding and receiving
brief audience, a fat man with an indictable
face; a man disreputable, vast and unkempt,
with a sloven’s shoebrush for beard. Him,
so propitiously ill-favored, Aughinbaugh
dogged to Leo’s satrapy. There Leo took
cognizance of him and, after a window-breaking
progress, companied him to Juarez.</p>

<p>Mindful of Pringle’s adventure and mishap
with the Judge he took a long chance.
Reasoning that, if their theories held good,
this man would take the same route the Judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
did, Leo left the car at the first street before
San Rafael and followed it eastward till he
came to Calle Terrazas. After heartbreaking
delay he had the satisfaction of seeing his
man turn the corner above and come lurching
on his way. Apparently the delay had not
been totally unconnected with the wineshops
en route.</p>

<p>Leo took refuge in a curio store, buying
things he did not in the least want. Emerging
with his compulsory parcels, he followed
in the wake of the unwieldy leviathan to the
International Hotel. Leo entered shortly
after him, ordered supper, and went into
eclipse behind a paper. The big man took
another at the bar, called for his key and
stumbled upstairs.</p>

<p>Supper over, Leo loafed aimlessly; and so
became involved in many games of pool with
a person in a voluble plaid vest—who beat
him shamefully. After this hanger-on had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
been encouraged a few times, a careless mention
of the big man ‘on the bat’ elicited the
information that the big man’s name was
Borrowman, that he was off his schedule by
reason of his hilarity, since he usually did
night work—running a stationary engine, the
pool shark thought, or something like that—that
he was a sulky swine and several other
things.</p>

<p>Ballinger lost enough more games and departed
to ’phone Aughinbaugh. Not getting
him, he next sent urgent summons to Billy
Beebe’s hotel, the whereabouts of John Wesley
being problematical in the extreme. Mr.
Beebe was not in; but the clerk would deliver
any message when he came. So Leo
made an appointment, naming a hostelry in
the block adjacent to the International,
whither he repaired, engaged a room and kept
sharp watch till Billy came.</p>

<p>After consultation, Billy registered at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
International. Borrowman had not seen him
before, whereas he might easily remember
Ballinger’s face and become suspicious. This
was no ordinary chase: an alarm meant, in
this case, not a mere temporary setback, but
irremediable disaster. Leo went to El
Paso, left an ad. with the papers, the purport
of the same being that the search was “getting
warm for enemy of good men and true,”
and then hunted up Pringle and Aughinbaugh.
They returned to Juarez and there separated,
to a loitering patrol of the streets east, south
and north of the International House.</p>

<p>Billy passed a tedious evening in the office
and barroom of the International. At midnight
Borrowman had not shown up as expected;
it began to look as though his work
had gone by the board for that night. But
he came down shortly before one, little the
worse for his liquor, and set forth at once.</p>

<p>When Borrowman came out he turned east<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
at the first corner. A little in front of him
was a slim and sauntering youth—Aughinbaugh
by name—who presently quickened his
pace and drew ahead, keeping straight on.
Far behind, Beebe brought up the rear, and
on the next streets, paralleling the quarry’s
course, came Pringle on the north and Ballinger
on the south, with varying gaits; one
or the other waiting at each corner till the
chase had crossed between them.</p>

<p>So the pursuit drew on for blocks. Aughinbaugh
was far ahead, when, near the town’s
edge, Borrowman turned to the left again,
northward to the river. The chase wheeled
with him—Pringle, a block to the north,
crossed the street openly and walked briskly
ahead; Billy turned riverward on the street
west of him; Aughinbaugh brought up the
east side, and Ballinger fell in behind.</p>

<p>There was no more doubling. Pringle,
in front, saw the river close ahead. The end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
must be near; he turned east into a side street
and disappeared. Borrowman kept straight
on; Ballinger, hidden in a doorway, close
behind, saw him enter an adobe house on
the river bank. It was a dark and shuttered
house; no light appeared from within, but
smoke was rising from the chimney.</p>

<p>Ballinger turned back, rounded the block
and so foregathered with Aughinbaugh and
Pringle. After a long wait Beebe joined
them, guided at the last by sundry guarded
whistlings; slowly, stealthily, tiptoe, they
glided through the rustling shadows to reconnoiter.</p>

<p>The old adobe was flat-roofed and one-storied,
as usual. They found chinks in the
shuttered windows. No fire was to be seen;
the smoke came from an underground room;
the hunt was over.</p>

<p>Billy plucked Pringle by the sleeve and bent
over, clasping Leo in a fond embrace. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
wordless investigation of this human stairway,
by sense of touch, Pringle stepped from Billy’s
back to Ballinger’s broad shoulders, and so
wriggled to the roof with noiseless caution.</p>

<p>After an hour-long infinity he reappeared,
bulked black and startling against the starlight;
descended, led his little flock to the
safety of the open <i>playa</i> by the river bank
and made exultant oration:</p>

<p>“Jeff’s there! Having the time of his
life! Chimney goes straight down; I could
hear every word they said. They’re a clever
gang of all-round crooks, counterfeiters,
smugglers and what-not. Thorpe is the
brains. They have a stand-in with some of
the police and officials. This cellar was used
as a warehouse for storing Chinamen, to be
smuggled across in boatload lots. The other
man on guard is fat, as we expected, and
better looking than Borrowman. He was
hopping mad at Borrowman for getting full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
and leaving him on guard overtime; threatened
him with discipline, gave him a tongue-lashing—Jeff
egging him on, enjoying himself
very much and urging Borrowman not to
stand such abuse. He wouldn’t trust Jeff
to Borrowman till he was comparatively
sober; cussed him again and made him
turn in to sleep it off. So of course they’ll
both be here all night.”</p>

<p>“Why, how can you tell that this other
man is better looking than Borrowman?”
asked George, puzzled. “You couldn’t possibly
see him.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I didn’t—I’ve seen Borrowman,
haven’t I?” retorted Pringle triumphantly.</p>

<p>“What else did you gather?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, not much except that we had it
all figured out about right. They kept him
there at first to make him join ’em. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
wouldn’t, and what they are keeping him for
instead of wiping him out I don’t just see.
I’d sure hate to have to keep him. And now,
boys, us for El Paso, U. S. A. No more to
be done here to-night.”</p>

<p>“How are we going to get him out without
getting him slightly killed?” demanded
George. “I can sit down in an office and
study things out, all right—I learned deduction
from observing Hibler’s methods of
settling up estates. But when it comes to violent
action I don’t know which foot goes
first.”</p>

<p>“Easiest thing there is,” said Pringle.
“We’ll put him wise by a personal. To-morrow
we’ll keep out of sight for a day
to give him time to see it. We’ll get a hook,
a line and a gun, wait till only one man is
with Jeff, till Jeff is standing by the fire, and
till he gives us the signal we mention in our
little ad. Then we let the gun down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
chimney to him and he’ll do the rest. Why,
it’s the only way! There ain’t no other way,
and couldn’t be. Two days more and the
jig is strictly up. Let’s go home and sleep
those two days.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE tracking of Borrowman had ended
on Wednesday in the wee sma’ hours.
On Friday Jeff found this communication in
his morning paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Run to earth hear everything by hot air
now is time for party to aid himself to-night
at nine sharp be at fire signal when ready
by cowboy’s lament hold fast all six fine
friends I give you.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Jeff was pleased. Yet this was the hardest
day of his captivity. He made things very
unpleasant for Borrowman, who was on
guard, his drunk having disarranged the
previous schedule. The day dragged slowly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
on. Mac came at seven and Borrowman left
as soon as supper was cooked.</p>

<p>Jeff had let the fire run low. He stood
with his back to it, carrying on an earnest
conversation with Mac, who sat on the
bed.</p>

<p>“What time is it, Mac?”</p>

<p>“Eight-feefty.”</p>

<p>“Most bedtime,” said Jeff, yawning.
“Can’t you manage to stick it out till this
time to-morrow night?” he demanded querulously.
“That’ll put it back the way it
was, so Borrowman’ll be on while I’m asleep.
That filthy brute isn’t fit for a gentleman to
associate with. Besides, he’ll be letting me
get away.”</p>

<p>“He’s all that and worse,” said Mac, grinning
toothsomely, “but he’ll na let ye get
away. Man, I jalouse he fair aches to kill
ye. Ye treat him with much disrespect.
Ye’ll na get away from him or me, neither.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
We’ll hold you here till crack o’ doom, if
need be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ll escape sooner or later, of
course,” said Jeff pleasantly. “And that reminds
me—I’ll be wanting a hat before long.
I wish you’d get me a good one. You didn’t
fetch mine here, you know. I suppose the
barrel of Broderick’s gun cut it. Certainly
it did. How else could it have cut my head
open so? Get a J. B., 7⅛, four-inch brim,
pearl gray. It’ll supply a long-wanted felt.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ll need no hat. Man, ye vex me wi’
your frantic journeys. Ye canna escape. It
is na possible. If ye do, ye may e’en take
my hat, for I’ll no be needin’ it mair.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’ll not argue with you. It
just ruffles you up, without convincing you of
your error,” said Jeff. “But you’re wrong.”
He turned his face to the fire and lightly
hummed the first line of the Cowboy’s Lament:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“‘<i>As I rode down to Latern in Barin</i>——’”</p>

<p>Immediately the long, blue barrel of a .45
nosed inquiringly down the chimney. Jeff
disengaged the gun from the hook and slipped
it under his coat. He jerked the line slightly;
it was drawn up. Jeff left the fire and sat
down, facing Mac across the table.</p>

<p>“Mac what?” he demanded. “We’ve
spent a good many pleasant days together, but
I don’t know your name till this very yet.
Mac what?”</p>

<p>“It is no new thing for men of my blood
to be nameless,” said Mac composedly. His
voice took on a tone of pride; his bearing was
not without a certain dignity. “For generations
we were a race proscribit, outlawed,
homeless and nameless. The curse of yon
wild man Ishmael was ours, and the portion
of unblessed Esau—to live by the sword
alone, wi’ the dews of heaven for dwelling-place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> 
Who hasna heard of the Gregara?”</p>

<p>“Oh! So you’re a MacGregor? Well,
Mr. MacGregor, it is likewise said in that
same book that they who take up the sword
shall perish by the sword,” said Jeff, fondling
the gun handle beneath the table. “It seems
almost a pity that an exception should be
made in your case. For you have your
points; I’ll not deny it. Of course, you richly
deserve to be hung on the same scaffold with
Thorpe. But you are so much the more
wholesome scoundrel of the two, so straightforward
and thoroughgoing in your villainy,
that I must admit that I shall feel a certain
regret at seeing you make such an unsatisfactory
end. Besides, you don’t deserve it
from me. If Thorpe had listened to you I
would never have escaped to hang you both.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you then,” said MacGregor
with spirit, “that I could hang in no better
company. And I shall na stumble on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
gallow-steps. Dinna trouble yourself. If I
could hang for him it would be na mair than
he has deservit at my hands. He has been
staunch wi’ me. Wi’ wealth and name to
lose, he broke me out of San Saba prison
wi’ his own hands, where else I had been
rotting now. But we talk foolishness.” He
tamped tobacco into his pipe, struck a match
and held it over the bowl.</p>

<p>“I assure you that I do not,” said Jeff
earnestly. “But I’ll change the subject.
Did you know there was a much shorter sentence
with all the letters in it than we’ve
been using? There is. ‘Pack my box with
five dozen liquor jugs.’ It reached me by
R. F. D. So did this!”</p>

<p>He rose; the long barrel leaped to level
with sinister exultance. “Hold your hands
there, Mr. MacGregor—it’ll warm your
fingers.”</p>

<p>The MacGregor held his fingers there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
eying the unwavering blue barrel steadily.
He kept his pipe going. Bransford could
not withhold his admiration for such surly,
indomitable courage. Making a wary circuit
to the rear of the defeated warrior, and
keeping him covered, he gingerly reached
forth to take the MacGregor gun. “Now
you can take ’em down. Come on, boys—all
clear!” he said, raising his voice.</p>

<p>Sound of running feet from above; the
outer door smashed open. Mac flung his hat
over to Jeff and sat glowering in wordless
rage. Footsteps hurried down the stairs and
the passageway. An ax hewed at the door.
It crashed in; Pringle, gun in hand, burst
through the splintered woodwork; the others
pressed behind. John Wesley leaned upon
his ax, fumbled at his coat pocket, and extended
the famous leather bottle:</p>

<p>“Well, Brutus, old pal, we meet again!
Shall we smile?”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“NOW, we must get to work,” said Jeff,
after hurried mutual explanations.
“The natural impulse is to throw the customs
house into the river, to link arms and walk
up Main Street, five abreast, pushing the
policemen off of the curb, raising our feet
high and bringing them down ker-smack—hay-foot,
straw-foot, right foot, left: now is
the time for all good men—and the rest of
it. But, perhaps, it wouldn’t be wise. We’ve
got to catch Thorpe off his guard—and that
may be hard to do——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>Wes’ pulled him down and whispered in
his ear. Jeff’s face became radiant.</p>

<p>“And after we have him safe we’ll get
the others. Let’s go down to the bank and
steal a boat. Boys, this is Mr. MacGregor.
We’ll take him with us. Mac, you’d better
tie a handkerchief around your head. You’ll
take cold.”</p>

<p>“Ye canna take a man from Mexico without
extradeetion papers. It’s fair keednappin’,”
said Mac with a leer.</p>

<p>“So we can’t, so we can’t,” said Jeff pleasantly.
“Not live men. Go first. If you
don’t come quietly——”</p>

<p>“Dinna tell me,” said the MacGregor
scornfully. “Would I no have done as much
for you? But let me tell you one thing—and
that is that ye are showing small thanks
to Thorpe for sparing your life.”</p>

<p>“Fudge! I didn’t ask him for my life
and I owe him no gratitude,” said Jeff. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
was a square contract. I was to hang him if
I could escape—and I had practically escaped
when he agreed to it, except for the mere
detail of time. I am doing nothing unfair.
Go on!”</p>

<p>“You’re right, ’twas a contract—I’ll say
nae mair,” admitted Mac grudgingly, and
went up the stair.</p>

<p>Once on the street, however, he paused.
“Mr. Bransford, there have been kindly
passages atween us. Let me have a word
more.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Jeff.</p>

<p>The outlaw sat him down on a crumbling
wall. “I value your good opeenion, Mr.
Bransford, and I would not have ye judge
that fear held me from fightin’ ye, drop or
no drop. ’Twould have done no good to
any one and I should certainly have been
killed. Men, ye’ve a grand idee of strategy
yourself. I wouldna hae ye think I’m daft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
enough to throw away my life to no good
purpose. But there the case is verra diff’rent.
There are no thick walls now to muffle the
noise: ye canna keel me wi’oot muckle deesturbance,
bringin’ the police on ye. Thorpe
has friends here, verra alert folk—and ’gin
he gets wind o’ any deesturbance at just this
place—ye see!” He wagged his head in
slow cunning; he drew in a long breath.
“<i>Ho!</i>” he bellowed. “<i>Ho! Murder!</i>”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe43" id="i_164">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_164.jpg" alt="They pulled him down, fighting savagely.">

</figure>

<p>“Damnation!” said Jeff, and sprang at
his throat. The others had his arms: they
pulled him down, fighting savagely, turned
him over, piled on his back, and gagged him.
But it was too late. Two policemen were
already running down the street. The neighbors,
however, kept prudently within doors.</p>

<p>“Jeff, you and Pringle hike for the U. S.
A.,” gasped Leo. “Get Thorpe, anyhow.
I’ll tap this devil dumb, and stay here and
stand the gaff, to give you a start.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Hold on! Don’t do it,” said Beebe.
“Let me talk to the policemen. Do you tie
Mr. MacGregor up.”</p>

<p>“Talk to—why you can’t even speak
Spanish!” said Pringle.</p>

<p>“You don’t know me. Watch!” said
Billy.</p>

<p>Without waiting for further remonstrance
he went to meet the advancing officers. They
halted; there was a short colloquy and, to the
amazement of the three friends, they turned
amicably back together and passed from sight
at the next corner.</p>

<p>“Let me make a suggestion,” said Aughinbaugh.
“Lug this gentleman back to Jeff’s
quarters, tie him up tight, and I think I
can undertake to keep him while you get
your man. As soon as you have Thorpe,
see Tillotson’s lawyers and let them swear
out warrants for the arrest of Patterson and
the cab driver, and then take steps to secure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
Borrowman and Mr. MacGregor legally.
You can have them arrested for kidnapping
or illegal detention, and held here until we
can get extradition papers. You might send
some one—or two, or three—over right away,
in case Mr. Borrowman drops in. He might
eat me if he found me there alone. For
myself, I am not sorry to remain in the background.
I have no desire for prominence.
You fellows are going back to Rainbow—and
you’re used to trouble anyway, so it’s
all very well for you. But I have to stay
here and I’m a legal-minded person. This
will be a hanging matter for some of ’em
before they get done with it. They’ll talk
like the parrot. I’ve no desire to make a lot
of enemies. There’s no knowing how many
leading lights may be implicated in this thing
when they go to turning state’s evidence.”</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by a kick from
the gagged prisoner. It was not a vicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
kick and evidently meant only to attract attention.
They bent over him. He was
shaking his head; in the starlight his eyes
blazed denial.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean you,” said George, respectfully
and apologetically. “I’m sure you
wouldn’t do such a thing. But Borrowman
might, and Patterson will be even more
likely to betray the others to save his
own neck.”</p>

<p>The eyes expressed gloomy agreement.
At Pringle’s urging, Mac consented to walk
back down to the underground room. That
wily veteran evidently reserved his stubbornness
till there was a chance to accomplish
something by it. They were binding him to
the bed when Billy rejoined them. “Well!
Wherever did you learn Spanish, Billy?”
said Pringle curiously.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t Spanish—not exactly,” said
that accomplished linguist modestly. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
was a sort of Esperanto. I met them
with a cocked revolver in one hand and
a roll of bills in the other. They took
the bills.”</p>

<p>Jeff’s sprightly spirits were somewhat dampened.
“Whoever would have looked for
such stubborn loyalty from this battered old
rascal?” he demanded, sighing. “Even
Thorpe is not altogether to be despised—or
pitied. He had a friend. By Heavens,
Mac! I’ll take every precaution to hold fast
to you—but I find it in my heart to hope you
get away in spite of me.” He bent over
and met the dauntless eyes; he laid his fingers
on Mac’s hair, almost tenderly. “I’ll tell
him, old man,” he whispered.</p>

<p>He turned away, but after a step or two
paused and looked back with an irresolution
foreign to his character. He finally came
back and sat on the edge of the bed, with
his back to the MacGregor. He squeezed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
his hands between his knees, idly clicking his
heels together. His eyes were intent on a
crack in the floor: he recited in a dull monotone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘And often after sunset, sir,</div>
<div class="indent">When it is bright and fair,</div>
<div class="verse">I take my little derringer</div>
<div class="indent">And eat my supper there!’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The others waited by the door. John
Wesley posted George with a sedate and
knowing wink. George eyed these movements
of Jeff’s with grave disapproval.</p>

<p>“How often have I heard you denounce
precisely such proceedings as these, as the
fatal vice of Hamleting!” he jeered. “Flip
up a dollar! Or are you going to favor us
with a soliloquy?”</p>

<p>Jeff raised his eyes. “I was just trying
to remember an old story,” he explained innocently.
“My grandfather was a Hudson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Bay man, and this story was a John Company
tradition when he was a boy. It’s
about two canny Scots. That’s what put me
in mind of it, Mac being a Scotchman—and
in trouble.</p>

<p>“Their names were Kerr and McKensie.
One day Kerr upset his canoe in some rapids
and lost everything he had but his clothes
and his sheath-knife. But at dark he happened
on McKensie’s camp, and stayed the
night with him. McKensie had a good outfit—canoe,
rifle, grub, traps, and a big bundle
of furs. He had also a deserved reputation
for shrewdness and thrift. And in the night
they got to trading.</p>

<p>“When morning came McKensie had the
sheath-knife and Kerr had everything else.
McKensie would never explain what happened.
When asked about it he looked a
little dazed. He said, with marked emphasis:</p>

<p>“‘Yon is a verra intelligent pairson!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
The moral is, You’ve got to be careful with
a Scotchman.”</p>

<p>“You get out!” said George indignantly.
“Go gather the Judge. I’ll ’tend to Mac.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jeff. “We’ll go. But
don’t say I didn’t warn you.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Judge Thorpe was particularly well pleased
with himself. After a prosperous and profitable
day and a pleasant evening at his club,
he bethought himself of his old relentless
enemy, obesity, and made his way to the
Turkish baths.</p>

<p>He had been boiled, baked and basted, and
now lay swathed in linen on a marble slab,
blissfully drowsy, waiting to be curried. He
was more than half asleep when the operator
came.</p>

<p>When the currying process began, however,
the Judge noticed that the hostler
seemed anything but an expert. Why had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
they not sent Gibbons as usual? He opened
his eyes, intending remonstrance, but closed
them immediately; they were playing tricks
on him. A curious thing! The white-tunicked
attendant, seen through the curling
spirals of steam, looked startlingly like his
prisoner in Juarez. The Judge’s heart
skipped a beat or two and then started with
a fearful thumping.</p>

<p>The rubber plied his mitten briskly; the
Judge opened his eyes again. Of course the
prisoner was safe; the illusion was doubtless
the effect of the perspiration on his eyelashes.
The billowy vapor parted, the industrious
attendant bent impersonally over
him with a serene, benevolent look—Good
Heavens!</p>

<p>The Judge’s heart died horribly within him,
his tongue was dry, his bones turned to water
and his flesh to a quivering jelly. He cast a
beseeching look to the open door. Beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
it, looking idly in, were three men in street
clothes. They entered, ranging themselves
silently against the wall. They looked
amused. Thorpe’s lips moved, but no words
came.</p>

<p>Jeff Bransford rubbed away assiduously;
there was a quizzical glint in his pleasant
brown eyes. “My wife, Judge,” he said
cheerfully, jerking his head to introduce
Beebe, “and my two boys, Wes’ and Leo.
Fine, well-grown boys, aren’t they?” He
prodded the Judge’s ribs with a jocular
thumb. “Say, Judge—how about that presentiment
now?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>After personally attending the Judge and
Patterson to jail, the G. M. A. T. felt that
the capture of minor offenders might safely
be left to the government. So they routed out
Tillotson’s lawyers at the unseemly hour of
4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, broke the news gently, and haled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
them off to jail for consultation with Tillotson.</p>

<p>Congratulation and explanation was over:
the cumbrous machinery of the law was fairly
under way (creakingly, despite liberal oiling),
and a gorgeous breakfast for all hands was
being brought into the jail from a nearby
restaurant, when the jailer ushered Aughinbaugh
into the presence of the friends in
council.</p>

<p>He sauntered in with the most insouciant
and complacent air imaginable. El Paso’s
best cigar was perked up at a jaunty angle
from the corner of his mouth; it was plain
he was particularly well pleased with himself.</p>

<p>“Hello! where’s your prisoner?” said the
firm in chorus.</p>

<p>Aughinbaugh removed the cigar and flicked
the ash. “Mac? He got away,” he said
indifferently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span></p>

<p>“Got away!” shrieked the senior lawyer.
“Gagged, bound hand and foot, tied to the
bed—and got away!”</p>

<p>Aughinbaugh surveyed him placidly, and
waved his cigar in graceful explanation.</p>

<p>“Yon was a verra intelligent pairson!”
said he.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">Chapter I</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NEIGHBOR JONES gazed meditatively
from his room in the Saragossa
House: an unwelcome guest buzzed empty
boastings in his ear. He saw, between narrowed
lids, the dazzle of bright tracks, the
Saragossa Station, the bright green of irrigated
fields beyond, merged to a vague and
half-sensed background. The object of his
attentive consideration was nearer at hand,
by the west-most track—a long, squat warehouse,
battered and dingy red. And from
this shabby beginning, while the bore droned
endlessly on, Neighbor Jones wove romance
for his private delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>The warehouse was decked all about by
a wide, high platform. A low-pitched roof
reached far out beyond the building to overhang
this platform, so that the whole bore a
singular resemblance to Noah’s Ark of happy
memory. A forlorn and forgotten ark:
the warped shingles, the peeling, blistered
paint, the frayed and splintered planks, were
eloquent of past prosperity and of change,
neglect and decay.</p>

<p>The gable end was crowded with huge lettering
of whitish gray. When those gray
letters were white the sign had read:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Brown, Almandares</span> &amp; <span class="smcap">Company<br>
general merchandise<br>
best prices<br>
for wool and hides</span></p>

<p>Long ago the firm name had been painted
out; but the old letters broke dim and ghostly
through, persisted stubborn under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
paint that would blot them, hid and haunted
beyond the letters of a later name:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Martin Bennett</span></p>

<p>Bennett had been the Company.</p>

<p>Neighbor Jones sprawled largely in his
tilted chair, smoking with vast and enviable
enjoyment. One hand was pocketed. The
other, big, strong, blunt-fingered, tapped on
the window sill a brave tattoo of ringing
hoofs—no finicky, mimimy tanbark trot, but
steady and measured, a great horse breasting
the wind and the rain. To this strong
cadence Neighbor Jones trolled a merry
stave from the amazing ballad of the Chisholm
Trail:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>Foot in the saddle and a hand on the horn;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Best old cowboy ever was born.</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Hi, yi—yi—yippy, yippy hi—yi—yi!</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Hi—yi—yi—yippy—yippy—yea!—</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>In the lines of the long taper from broad
shoulders to booted feet; in the massive
broad-browed head; the tawny hair; the
square, ruddy-brown face; the narrowed
sleepy eyes—in every mold and motion of
the man, balanced and poised, there was
something lionlike; something one might do
well to remark.</p>

<p>But his one companion, the Kansas City
Kid, remarked none of those things. The
Kansas City Kid was otherwise engrossed—with
his own cleverness.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll show you, all right! There’s
one born every minute,” said the K. C. Kid
crisply. “How many hands? Five? Five
is right. Second hand for Jones; first hand
is the winner. Watch me close!”</p>

<p>He shuffled the cards with a brisk and
careless swing, cutting them once, twice,
thrice, with flourish and slap; shuffled again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
with a smooth ripple pleasant to the ear, and
shoved the deck across for a final cut.</p>

<p>“See anything wrong? No? Here we
go! Watch!” He dealt five poker hands,
face down. “Now then, look! You’ve got
three tens and a pair of trays. First hand has
jacks up, opens, stands a raise from you,
draws one black jack.” Illustrating, the Kid
flipped the top card from the deck. It was
the spade jack. “Then you bet your fool
head off. He should worry. And that’s the
way they trimmed you—see?”</p>

<p>Neighbor Jones blinked a little and twisted
his tawny-gold hair to a peak, retaining
unshaded and unchanged his look of sleepy
good nature.</p>

<p>“Smooth work!” he said approvingly.</p>

<p>“You’re dead right, it’s smooth work!”
asserted the gratified artist. “Some class to
that! Them guys that got yours couldn’t do
any such work—they was raw! I’m showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
you what I got, so you can figure out the surprise
party you and me can hand to ’em—see?
Say, they pulled a lot of stunts the Old
Ladies’ Home is wise to back in my town—strippers,
short cards, holdouts, cold decks—old
stuff! Honest, they make me sick! I
can steal the gold out of their teeth and
they’ll never miss it!”</p>

<p>Jones looked at the man with wonder and
pity. The poor wretch was proud of his
sorry accomplishment, displayed it with
pleasure, thought himself envied for it. By
this shameful skill he had come so far, in the
pride and heyday of youth—to such dire
shifts, such ebbs and shallows; to empty
days, joyless, friendless, without hope of any
better morrow. No dupe he had gulled but
might grieve for him, cut off, clean aside
from all purpose or meaning of life.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the Kid impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>The contemplative gentleman roused himself.</p>

<p>“Someway I don’t like this idea of being
cheated pretty well.” His voice was a mild
and regretful drawl. “Never had much use
for Beck; but I did think old Scanlon was a
square old sport!”</p>

<p>“Square sport! Why, you poor simp, you
never had a look in!” sneered the sharper.
Then he wrinkled his brows in some perplexity.
“What I don’t see is why they didn’t
skin the Eastern chap too. They could ’a’
had that gink’s wad—that Drake; but they
let him down easy. Oh, well, we should
worry! It will leave all the more for us.”</p>

<p>“For us?” echoed Neighbor, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Sure, Mike! You get hold of a good
piece of money and we’ll do a brother act.
You and me, we ain’t never been chummy—they
won’t tumble. We’ll sit in with ’em and
string along with ’em till the big money gets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
out in the open—just holding enough cards
to keep in the swim. When I give you the
office, go get ’em! I’ll slip big ones to Beck
and the college Johnny—and the top hand to
you, of course—and we’ll split fifty-fifty.”</p>

<p>Neighbor’s mind groped back along the
dusty years for a half-forgotten adage.</p>

<p>“If a dog bites you once,” he said with
halting speech, “shame on him; if you bite a
dog—shame on you!”</p>

<p>“Huh? I don’t get you.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” said Neighbor placidly, “you’ll
be going away now.”</p>

<p>“Not me. Saragossa looks good to me.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be going away,” repeated Neighbor
patiently, “on the next train—any direction—and
never coming back!”</p>

<p>“What?” The Kid jumped up, blazing
wrath. “Why, you cheap skate—you quitter!
Are you goin’ to throw me down?
You come-on! You piker——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Boob?” suggested Neighbor kindly.
“Mutt? Sucker?”</p>

<p>“You hick! You yellow hound——”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” advised Neighbor quietly.</p>

<p>“You ought to lose your money! For ten
cents——”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” said Neighbor more quietly.
The pocketed hand produced a dime and slid
it across the table. “Go on with that ten-cent
job you had on your mind, whatever it
was,” said Neighbor. “There’s the money.
Pick it up!”</p>

<p>Weight and inches, the two men evened up
fairly well. Also, the ivory butt of a forty-four
peeped from the Kid’s waistband. But
Neighbor’s eye was convincing; here was a
man who meant the thing he said. The
younger man shifted his own eyes uneasily,
checked, faltered and sat down.</p>

<p>“Pick up your dime!” said Neighbor. The
Kid complied with a mumbling in his throat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
“That’s right,” said Jones. “Now, don’t
you be too proud to take advice from a yellow
hound. First, don’t you bother your
poor head about me losing my money. My
money don’t cost me anything,” he explained—“I
work for it. Next, about Beck—I’ll
sleep on this matter and look it over from
all sides. No hurry. If I’m not just pleased
with Beck for cheating me I’ll adjust the matter
with him—but I’ll not cheat him. I never
try to beat a man at his own game. Toddle
along, now. I hear a train coming. By-by!”</p>

<p>“It’s the freight. I’ll go on the five-o’clock
passenger—not before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes you will!” said Jones confidently.
“You’ve only accused Beck of cheating, but
you’ve proved it on yourself. The boys won’t
like it. It is best to leave me thus, dear—best
for you and best for me.” His eyes
wandered to the window and rested calculatingly
on the Fowler cottonwood across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
street. It was a historic tree; Joel Fowler
had been hanged thereon by disapproving
friends.</p>

<p>The Kid caught the glance and the unspoken
allusion; sweat beaded his forehead.</p>

<p>“Aw, lemme wait for the passenger!” he
protested. “I gotta go up to the Windsor
to pay what I owe and get my suit case.”</p>

<p>Neighbor rose.</p>

<p>“There, there! Don’t you fret,” he said,
patting the other man’s shoulder kindly.
“Give me the money. I’ll pay your bill and
keep the suit case. You just run along.”</p>

<p>“Good lord, man! Those clothes cost
me——”</p>

<p>“Now, now! Never mind—that’s all
right—everything’s all right!” said Neighbor
soothingly. “We’re just about of a size.”
He nudged the Kid’s ribs with a confidential
elbow. “Sly old dog! You had some of my
money too, didn’t you? Yes; and I’ll keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
that cunning little gun of yours as a souvenir.”
The last remark came after—not before—Neighbor’s
acquisition of the cunning
little gun. “Come on, my boy, we’ll mosey
along over to the station. Here’s our hats,
on the bed.”</p>

<p>He linked his arm with the victim’s: he
sang with a joyous and martial note:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>Hark! From the tombs a doleful sound;</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Maryland, my Maryland!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>My love lies buried underground;</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Maryland, my Maryland!</i>”</div>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">Chapter II</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was nearing two <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> when Mr. Jones,
after speeding the parting Kid, made his
way uptown. Upstairs was the word in his
thought. Saragossa is built that way. Let
Saragossa Mountain, close and great and
golden, stand for the house; the town will
then be the front steps. The first step is
Venice, in the lush green of the valley—railroad
buildings, coal chute, ferryman, warehouses,
two nth-class hotels, and a few farmhouses,
all on stilts, being a few feet above
the Rio Grande at low water and a few feet
under it at high water. Whence the name,
Venice.</p>

<p>On the first rising ground to the westward
is the business quarter, as close to the railroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
as safety permits. A step up comes to a sheltered,
sunny terrace and to the Old Town—the
Mexican village dating back to before
the great uprising of 1680. Another, a steep
and high step, rose to the residence section,
on a strip of yellow mesa; for Saragossa has
water piped from the high hills, so please
you, and is not confined to the lowlands, like
most of her New Mexican sisters. Still
above, on the fifth and last step, smelter and
mining town clung to a yellow-brown slope
reached by a spur of railroad looping in a
long bow-knot from the valley below.</p>

<p>Above all, sheer and steep, circling about,
sheltering, brooding, hung Saragossa Mountain,
rose and gold in mid-day or morning
sun; blue and rose-edged when the long shadows
thrust eastward stealthily, steadily—crept
like kittens at play, or like them fell off,
down those old, old steps.</p>

<p>Something of all this Neighbor saw and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
put into thoughts—not into words. Saw, too,
all beyond and all about, the vast and sun-drenched
land of all colors and all shapes—valley
and plain and mesa, shelf and slope
and curve, and bend and broken ridge and
hill; great ranges against the turquoise sky,
near or far, or far beyond belief, saw-toothed
or wall-straight or rounded—every one precisely
unlike any other visible mountain or any
other possible mountain. By this cause his
step was sprightly and glad, his eye bright,
his chin well up—a very sincere way of thanking
God.</p>

<p>Now, as he swung along the street, he
voiced these thoughts in a little hymn of
praise. At least it sounded like a hymn of
praise as he sang it to a healthy and manful
tune; resonant, ringing, reverberant:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>Plunged in a gulf of dark despair</i>—</div>
<div class="indent"><i>Maryland, my Maryland!</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>On three sides of the shaded plaza business
was housed in modern comfort. In sharp
contrast, all along the north, sprawled an unbroken,
staring huddle of haphazard buildings—frame,
brick and adobe, tall and squat
jumbled together, broad fronted or pinched.
At the riverward corner, massive, ill-kept but
dominant still, was a great structure of gray-stone
once the luckless home of Brown and
Almandares.</p>

<p>Squalid, faded and time-stained, like Falstaff’s
rabble of recruits, this long row struck
sinister to the eye. Any stranger, seeing
what blight had fallen ominous and threatening
all about him, seeing on door after door
the same repeated name, might well guess the
whole ugly story. For this long, forlorn row
housed Bennett’s General Stores. Bennett
sold everything but tunnels.</p>

<p>Here was Neighbor’s nearest errand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
After a little delay he was shown into the
great man’s private office.</p>

<p>Bennett turned slowly in his revolving
chair; a tall spare man, with a thin straggle
of sandy hair and a sharp, narrow face, close-shaven;
which might have been a pleasant
face but for a pinched and cruel mouth, a
mean, pinched nose, and a shifty eye.</p>

<p>Here arose a curious contradiction. The
man had held the whip hand for years, his
conscious manner was overbearing and arrogant,
but his eyes betrayed him, and all the
unconscious lines of his face were slinking and
furtive. He now wore an austere frown.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jones, I hear you have been gambling.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>si</i>!” said Mr. Jones; and he made
those simple words convey enthusiasm,
brightness and joy. “And—but, also, what
do you suppose I hear about you? Give you
three guesses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“What!” Bennett gasped incredulously; he
crashed his fist down on the desk. “How
about that mortgage?”</p>

<p>Jones beamed triumphant.</p>

<p>“You see? You don’t like it yourself—meddlin’,
pryin’ and loose talk.”</p>

<p>“I’ll fix you! This’ll be the worst day’s
work you ever did—trying to get smart with
me!”</p>

<p>“Percival Pulcifer, will you kindly retain
your rompers?” said Neighbor with eminent
cheerfulness. “Now hark and heed! You
did not ask me to sit down. You are not a
nice old man. I do not like you much. Don’t
you touch that bell!... I shall now sit
down. Smoke? No? Well, I’ll roll one.”</p>

<p>Rolling one with tender care, Neighbor
cocked a pleasant but rather impish eye on
the seething financier and blithely prattled
on:</p>

<p>“Allow me to say, Mr. Banker, that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
are overlooking one point: You have a mortgage
on my cattle, but you haven’t got any
mortgage on me. Got that—clear?”</p>

<p>The banker gurgled, black faced and choking.</p>

<p>“I’ll ruin you! I’ll smash you!”</p>

<p>“Percival Pulcifer Peterkin Pool!”</p>

<p>For some reason, not at first easily apparent,
these harmless words, which Jones syllabled
with great firmness, made the banker
writhe. He was wonted to hate—but ridicule
was new to him and it hurt.</p>

<p>“You might at least show some respect for
my gray hairs,” he interrupted indignantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, dye your gray hairs!” said Neighbor
simply. “Damn your old gray hairs! Shoot,
if you must, that old gray head! You’re an
old gray-headed scoundrel—that’s what you
are!”</p>

<p>“Of course,” observed the gray-haired one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
gathering himself together, “you will be
ready with the money on the nail?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re talking sense!” cried Neighbor
warmly. “Now you’re getting down to
facts.” He threw back his head and sang
with great heartiness and zest:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>That day of wrath, that dreadful day;</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Maryland, my Maryland!</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>When heaven and earth shall pass away;</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Maryland, my Maryland!</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Clerks beyond the glass partition turned
startled faces that way. In that gloomy,
haunted counting room, used only to the tones
of meekness or despair, the echoes rolled
thunderous:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">
“<i>When, shriveling like a parchèd scroll,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The flaming heavens together roll——</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Will I have the money? <i>Quien sabe?</i> If
I don’t the brand is yours—party of the first
part, his heirs, executors and assigns forever—nary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
a whimper from this corner. If I
knew for certain I’d tell you, for you have a
plain right to know that; but that first line
of talk was just sickening drivel. If you held
a mortgage on a man’s stuff, would that give
you any right to go snoopin’ round and compel
him to get in a poker game—hey?
Would that look nice? Whaddy you mean,
then—how dast you, then—try to tell me not
to play poker—meddling in my private affairs?
How dare you? Shame-y! Shame-y!
S-s-h!”</p>

<p>“Jones,” said the other thickly, “I think the
devil himself is in you to-day. You poor,
headstrong fool! I sent for you to do you a
kindness.”</p>

<p>Jones rose anxiously.</p>

<p>“Shall I call a doctor?”</p>

<p>“Well, I did; but you make it hard for
me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! And you not used to doing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
kind things, either!” said Jones sympathetically.
“Go on. We’re all with you. Give it
a name.”</p>

<p>Bennett paced up and down, clasping his
hands behind his back.</p>

<p>“You know I have a cattle ranch out Luna
way? Ever been there?”</p>

<p>“Not any. I stick to the east side. Saragossa
is my furthest west; and, as you know,
I’ve never been here before. But don’t let
me interrupt. You were working yourself up
to a kindness.”</p>

<p>Bennett flinched at his careless contempt,
but he forced himself to go on.</p>

<p>“I was intending to offer you a job as my
foreman.”</p>

<p>Neighbor sat down with an air of relief.</p>

<p>“You don’t need no doctor. It’s yourself
you’re trying to be kind to. Go on with
your talk. For a starter—what would I do
with my own cattle?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“Sell, get a friend to run them; let them
out on shares. You wouldn’t need to worry
about the mortgage. It could stand over—you’ll
be getting good money. And,” said
the financier diffidently, spacing the words
and dropping his voice to tones singularly
flat and even, “if—everything—went—all—right,
the—mortgage—might—be—canceled.”</p>

<p>“Yes? How jolly! But what’s the matter
with the west-side cowmen? Can’t you
get some of the V T waddies? Should think
you’d rather use home talent.”</p>

<p>Bennett resumed his measured pacing. At
the end of each beat he turned, always away
from Neighbor’s eyes, so that he marked
out a distinct figure eight. Other men, unhappy
debtors, had walked that narrow
space, many of them; perhaps none so fiend-ridden
as he who now tracked back and
forth. The jeers of this uncringing debtor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
galled him to the quick, yet his purpose
drove him on.</p>

<p>“We have been having a little trouble on
the ranch. For many reasons I do not think
it wise to get a local man.” He coughed
gently, and went on in the same low and listless
manner of speech he had used in his hint
about the mortgage. “Trouble was between
my boys and the Quinliven outfit—the Double
Dee—about one of my watering places.
I have no legal title, but the spring is mine
by all the customs of the country. There
was some shooting, I believe. No one was
hurt, fortunately, but there is hard feeling.
I must put a stop to it. For his part in the
deplorable affair I let my foreman go—Tom
Garst. Know him?”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“So I thought I would get you for the
place.”</p>

<p>“Me being a notorious peacemaker and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
cheekturner, suffering long, and kind, not
easily provoked—yes, yes!”</p>

<p>“Quinliven himself would be willing to let
the matter drop, I think; but young Roger
Drake—why, you know young Drake—he
was one of your poker party!”</p>

<p>“The college lad—yes.”</p>

<p>“Nephew of Old Drake, Quinliven’s partner,
who died a month or two ago,” continued
Bennett, sedulously avoiding Neighbor’s
eye. “Young Drake is hot-headed;
says he’s going to hold that spring anyhow.
He—will—require—careful—handling.”
Again that slow, significant spacing of the
words.</p>

<p>As lifelessly Neighbor answered:</p>

<p>“And—if—I—handle—him—carefully;
if—everything—turns—out—all—right,
the—mortgage—will—be—canceled?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Bennett. He busied himself
at his desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>In a startled silence Neighbor rose, fold
after fold, interminable and slow. He fumbled
for matches, pipe and tobacco; thoughtfully,
thoroughly, he constructed a smoke.
Then he raised his eyes. Many a hard Ulysses-year
had passed over him, this old
Neighbor; but his eyes were clear and unstained
yet. They now observed Mr. Bennett
attentively.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Neighbor Jones. “I haven’t
got a thing fit to wear.”</p>

<p>At the door he turned. “Now, I’ll tell
you what you do,” he said kindly. He spread
out his left hand and drew a diagram down
the palm: “You go to hell and take the first
turn to the left!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">Chapter III</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DUCKY DRAKE—Roger Olcott
Drake, Second—dawdled over a
four-o’clock breakfast. He was in bathrobe
and slippers, his feet on a second chair; the
morning paper was propped before him and
the low western sun peeped through his windows.</p>

<p>The room phone rang. “Hel-lo-o! Gentleman
to see Mr. Drake—shall we show
him up?”... “Use your own judgment;
the last time I tried to show a man up he
worked my face over.” Bring him up, the
telephone meant. Mr. Drake desired particulars:
“What is the gentleman’s silly
name?”... “Jones. Cowpunch; six or
seven feet up; incredibly sober.”... “Sure,
Moike! Bring him along! Say, send some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
good smokes, will you?—and some swipes.
What’s that? What do I mean, swipes?
Beer, you idiot—beer!”</p>

<p>A clear eye, bright and black; a clean,
fresh-colored skin; a frank and pleasant face—that
was Ducky. He met his visitor at the
door.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you, Mr. Neighbor—welcome
to our well-known midst! Weather!
Chair! How’s every little thing? You look
chirpy enough. Shan’t I have breakfast sent
up for you?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you; I got up at noon. You
can give me a little help though.”</p>

<p>“Put it on the table, George. That’s all.”
George, known in private life as Gregorio,
departed, and Ducky turned to his
guest. “Whaddy you mean—help?” he demanded,
grinning sympathetically. “Did
they put the kibosh on you good and proper
after I quit last night?” He pushed the cigars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
over and began operations with a corkscrew.</p>

<p>“Oh, no—nothing like that. I want some
advice.”</p>

<p>“Advice? This is the right shop.” Roger
struck a Pecksniff pose, waved the corkscrew
aloft, and declaimed grandly: “Put your
eggs in one basket. Get on the wagon.
Hitch your wagon to a star. Mind your
step! When in doubt, play trumps. Be sure
you’re ahead and then go right home.”</p>

<p>“Not advice exactly—information.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Ducky. “A straight line is the
shortest distance between two points; the
woman who hesitations is lost; a Cobb in the
club is worth two in the bush; lead-pencil signatures
are good in law; a receiver is as bad
as a promoter; hospitality is the thief of
time; absinthe makes the heart grow fonder.”</p>

<p>Neighbor shoved a bottle of beer into his
host’s hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>“Drink, pretty creature, drink! Let me
explain: What I want is to ask some questions—about
words, and so on. You’re a
college Johnny, ain’t you?”</p>

<p>“Booze Arts, Harvard,” said Ducky.
“Not graduated yet.”</p>

<p>“Man staying here in the Windsor with
you—was staying here, gone now—used a
lot of words I don’t quite savvy.” Neighbor
leaned forward, blinking earnestly. “What
is the precise distinction between a mutt, a
simp, a gink and a boob? And what did he
mean by saying all the time, ‘I should
worry!’?”</p>

<p>Ducky placed the tips of his fingers accurately
together, and held his head on one
side, birdwise, pursing his lips precisely.</p>

<p>“The phrase I should worry is derived
from the Hebrew verb to bibble, meaning to
worry—I should bibble; you should bibble;
he or she should bibble. Plural: we should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
bibble; ye should bibble; they should bibble.</p>

<p>“Mutt, simp, gink and boob are scientific
terms employed rather indiscriminately by
philosophers of an idealistic tendency.
Broadly speaking, the words denote one
whose speech, manner, education, habits or
clothes differ in any respect from your own;
categorically, a thinker whose opinions and
ideals do not correspond in every particular
with your own. Exactly equivalent terms are—in
religion, heretic or infidel; in politics,
demagogue, blatherskite!”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Neighbor humbly.
“Myself, I understood him to mean almost
the same thing as a sucker; because this fellow—it
was the K. C. Kid, that sat on your
left—he spoke of you and me being mutts
and simps, and all them things; and at the
same time he said we’d been swindled, cheated
or skinned in that little poker game.”</p>

<p>Ducky made a passionate comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>“That alley-goat could sure stack the
cards. He showed me that,” said Neighbor,
and related the painful story of the K. C.
Kid’s flitting.</p>

<p>“We are the victims of the highly accomplished
fact,” said Roger. “We can’t very
well squeal; but can they do this to us with
the well-known impunity?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Neighbor; “they cannot. I’ll
make a note of it. We’ll not squeal and
we’ll not cheat; but we’ll give ’em their come-uppances
someway. I do not, as a general
thing, hold myself up for the admiration of
the good and wise; but I must say that I’ve
always got what I went after if I wanted it
hard enough.”</p>

<p>“‘Don’t flinch; don’t foul; hit the line
hard!’” said Roger. The words snapped
like a lash.</p>

<p>“Who said that? He did? Good for
him once! And I want this, hard. When I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
get my auger in I’ll give it another twist for
you, Mr. Ducky, in case you are not here.
You haven’t lost much anyhow. That’s funny
too! Huh! Our tinhorn friend noticed
that. Seems like they didn’t want to rob
you; and yet your wool was enough sight
longer’n mine. I don’t get the idea. I like
to understand things as I go along.”</p>

<p>“I won away quite a wad, all right; but
you might say I wasn’t a loser at all compared
to what I was two or three nights ago.
I was certain-lee in bad!” Ducky performed
a hospitable rite. “Well, we’ll have to give
up poker at Beck’s. Here’s how!”</p>

<p>“That brings me up to the main point,”
said Neighbor casually. “What have you
been and gone and done? Because a gentleman
just offered me the highest market price
for your scalp.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“He wanted me to abate you—to abolish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
you—to beef you—to murder you! Don’t
be so dumb! So I thought I’d drop in and
get your views.”</p>

<p>“What’s the joke?”</p>

<p>“It’s no joke. This <i>hombre</i> sure wants
you killed off. You’ll save time by taking
that for proved. And,” said Neighbor wistfully,
“I needed the money too.”</p>

<p>“But who—who——”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Jones. “Why—why?
You tell me why, why, first, and see how well
it fits in with who, who. I know the answer
all right but I haven’t heard the riddle yet.”</p>

<p>“Oi, yoi, yoi!” Young Drake sat up with
a sudden alertness and stared hard at his visitor.
“It’s Uncle Ducky’s money—that’s
why—I’ll bet a cooky!”</p>

<p>“Not with me, you won’t,” said Neighbor;
“for if your Uncle Ducky left any worldly
goods the gentleman that offers a bounty for
you is the very man to covet those goods.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Just how getting you killed would bring him
in anything I don’t almost see.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it!” cried Roger Drake.
“He’s got the money now—or somebody
has; I haven’t. I’m trying to find it.”</p>

<p>“Son,” said Neighbor judicially, “this
sounds real thrillin’. Tell it to me.”</p>

<p>Young Drake hesitated.</p>

<p>“No offense, Mr. Jones; but I have been
strongly advised to say nothing.”</p>

<p>Neighbor nodded eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Mystery; sorcery; silence;
wisdom! ‘But how do you know I’m honest?’
says the lad in the story. ‘Why,’ says
the other chap, ‘didn’t you just tell me so?’
Well, I’m honest. Go on! Also curious.
That’s why I want to be told; but here is
why you should want to tell me: If we were
back in New York town you’d understand
the ins and outs of things that I couldn’t
make a guess at, and that it would take you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
large, dreary centuries to tell me about.
Ever think of that?”</p>

<p>“I gotcha!” said Roger joyously. “And
this is your country, you mean; while I’m a
mere stranger——”</p>

<p>“Correct! Move up one girl! I never
saw a merer stranger than you, Mr. Ducky.
You’re so mere that none know you but to
love you. Why, the boys you’ve met up
with out on the range couldn’t even be hired
to kill you, and they had to offer me the
chance. Durned if I believe I’m going to
do it myself! G’wan now; let’s hear the sad
story of your life.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">Chapter IV</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WHEN I think of that poor little answer
waiting all alone for its own
dear riddle,” said Ducky, much affected, “I
can’t refuse. But I’ll only hit the high places.
Uncle Roger is dead, and it isn’t a pleasant
stunt to rake up all his faults and catalogue
’em.”</p>

<p>He reflected a little while.</p>

<p>“My uncle put me through college and
named me as his sole heir, for the reason—I
had it from his own lips—that he lost father’s
little property for him. Uncle Roger
was the elder brother, head of the family,
and all that.</p>

<p>“He had a mighty high idea of the Drakes,
did Uncle Roger, and he never liked my
mother. To the day of her death he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
barely civil to her. That’s what I couldn’t
forgive in him, for all his cold and formal
kindness to me. Damn it! He ignored her
and she was worth a hundred like Roger
Drake.</p>

<p>“From all accounts, my Uncle Roger was
a warm baby at college. He was the only
original Ducky Drake; all others were base
imitations. Come back to li’l’ ol’ N’ York—lawyer;
man about town; clubs; Tottie
Twinkletoes; birds and bottles at proper temperatures!
New York took his roll away
from him.</p>

<p>“Did he buckle down to business and, by
frugal industry—and so on? He did not.
He faded away into the dim blue and the
tall green. Honest, Jonesy, this is rotten of
me—knockin’ like this! But if you’re going
to help me play Money, money, who’s got
Uncle Ducky’s money? this is what you want
to know. It was the keynote of his character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
that he wanted all the beastly junk money
will buy, but wasn’t willing to hop out and
hustle for the money. He wanted it quick,
easy and often.”</p>

<p>“Mind if I take notes?”</p>

<p>“’Eavings, no! Well, six years afterward
he came back. A distant relative—great-aunt
or something—had left him a sizable
legacy. Business of killing calf. So he
took his money and poor old dad’s and set to
work to found an estate. Mother didn’t
know about it. I happened along about that
time and she took quite a fancy to me; didn’t
notice other things.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem possible that any one could
consistently lose money in real estate in a
thrifty, growing burg like New York, does
it? Uncle Roger did. Then he ducked
again.</p>

<p>“Some ten years later, back to New York—who
comes here? Is it my long-lost uncle?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
It is. Talked vaguely of holdings in New
Mexico. Had the mazuma, and spent it.
He stayed all winter; then back to New
Mex. That’s been the program ever since—four
to six months in New York, the rest
out here. But he didn’t talk about New
Mexico and he didn’t urge us to visit him
there.</p>

<p>“To do him justice, he made good on one
point. He came through with good hard
coin for dad. He was really very fond of
poor old dad, and he’d always been sore at
himself about losing dad’s wad. And, as I
said, he put his ungrateful nephew through
school.</p>

<p>“Two months ago we found him dead in
his bed—heart disease. His will left all his
property to me unconditionally. But where
and what was his property? He hadn’t told
us; and naturally dad hadn’t felt like asking
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>“Saragossa was his post office. Except a
pass book for his New York bank we found
no papers in his effects—not so much as a
letter. We applied at the bank.—Ahem!
Huh? Mr. Drake had opened an account
with them years ago; the balance was so
much—about one winter’s spending for
Uncle Roger. We pressed ’em a little. Very
irregular, said the bank; but, under the circumstances—ahem!
It had been Mr.
Drake’s custom to make one large deposit
each year, checking out the greater part of it
before he put in more. What was a little unusual,
he generally made these deposits personally
and in cash; sometimes—ahem!—there
had been drafts from Albuquerque or
El Paso.</p>

<p>“So there we were! How much property?
According to the pass book, Uncle
Roger had been spending, on the average,
about seven thousand a year, including his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
two extravagances—father and yours truly.
Said property was evidently in the grand new
state of New Mex. But where, what and
how much? Had Uncle Roger spent all his
income or only part of it? All of it, we
judged; for, with all respect to your so wonderful
Southwest, my Uncle Roger thought
life in any place more than half an hour
away from Broadway was a frost. If he
stayed there only four months in the year,
it was because supplies didn’t hold out.”</p>

<p>“I knew of your uncle—never saw him,”
said Neighbor. “He lived very quietly.
Stayed at the ranch mighty close; made no
friends and no enemies. No mixer. Had
no visitors from the outside. Hunted a little.
No cowman. He didn’t know anything
about cattle, he wouldn’t learn anything
about cattle, and he didn’t care anything
about cattle. Left that all to his partner.
That’s his rep, according to campfire talk.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
One thing’s certain—your uncle didn’t make
any seven thousand per from the ranch, or
any big part of it. The Double Dee outfit
doesn’t sell three hundred steers a year.
Your uncle only got half of that and paid
half the expenses. No, sir—that Double
Dee brand helped some, but it was mostly a
blind for something else.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m headed for,” said
Ducky. “Dad’s an invalid; so I came out.
At Albuquerque Mr. Drake had bought
drafts at the banks. The hotels knew him
but none of the business men had ever heard
of him. El Paso, ditto. So he couldn’t have
been engaged in any business openly, aside
from the ranch. I came to Saragossa. You
know what I found here. Uncle Roger’s
whole bunch of cattle would have made about
a year’s pocket money for him. His partner
offered me ten thousand for my half of
ranch and cattle. That’s enough to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the wolf from the well-known door, but hardly
what was expected.”</p>

<p>“Grab it! That’s more than it’s worth.
I know. Jim-Ike, my new neighbor, worked
that country last year.”</p>

<p>“Quinliven—Uncle Ducky’s pardner—showed
me the tally book. According to
that, my share would be about that much.”</p>

<p>Jones bent his head to hide a significant
smile.</p>

<p>“Take it! Well, what did he say about
your uncle?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t believe my uncle owned any
property here. Didn’t know what he might
have back East. Close-mouthed codger, he
was.</p>

<p>“My own idea all along had been that my
uncle had a secret mine. I put this up to
Quinliven. Secret mine? Rubbish! No one
could work a secret mine in this country—where
everything was known; where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
smoke of the strange camp fire was something
of vital interest, to be looked into at
once; where every cowpuncher had the time,
ability and inclination to follow up any
strange track.</p>

<p>“Fat chance, when all the freight from a
country as big as an Eastern state was handled
through one depot! Everybody knew
all ore shipped—where it came from and
what it run. Rubbish! Placer mines? ‘Mai
dear-r sir-r, to wash placer dirt, you must
have water; and where water is, in New
Mexico, is a frequented and public place.’
Nuggets? Pish! Bosh! Nowt!</p>

<p>“I questioned my uncle’s banker and his
lawyer. Great astonishment. Nothing
knowing. Mr. Bennett showed me the joint
account of Quinliven &amp; Drake, with a very
small balance. My uncle kept no private
account; he knew of no other investment my
uncle had made; no such sums as I mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
passed through his hands. The lawyer is
now trying to solve my problem for me.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the lawyer?”</p>

<p>“He’s a Mexican—a Mr. Octaviano Baca—and,
at first, it seemed a rum start that
Uncle Roger should have a native for his attorney.
But he’s a live one, all right; a very
shrewd, keen person, indeed. Educated, too—good
company; witty; speaks English with
fluency and precision—much better English
than I do. But doubtless you are acquainted
with him. He is, I am told, something of a
political power, having great influence with
the natives.”</p>

<p>Neighbor chuckled. He knew what young
Drake did not. Octaviano Baca was the
Boss—King of Saragossa.</p>

<p>“Know him by sight; never met him. But
we know all about everything here, even people
we’ve never seen. In this country our
campfire talks take the place of Bradstreet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
and Dun, or Who’s Who. Great help.
They ain’t afraid to say what they think,
them firelighters; and they ain’t afraid to
think what they say! We’re all catalogued.....
‘Jones, Neighbor. Good old wagon,
but needs greasing. Use no hooks.’...
That’s me. I’m mighty proud of that biography
too. So it is Baca and Bennett that are
looking after your interests?”</p>

<p>“Baca alone now,” corrected Ducky.
“Bennett helped at first, making inquiries
from his business connections, and so on. We
thought if we could unearth some investment
of my uncle’s we might follow it up; but
there was a silly gunplay on the range between
Bennett’s men and ours, and Bennett
thought he had better withdraw from the investigation;
because Quinliven took it up, you
know—grouchy old sorehead!—talked pretty
rough to Bennett, and took our account
over to the other bank.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“What was the trouble about—mavericks?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know—pure cussedness, I guess.
Nothing worth quarreling about. Tommy
Garst and one of our boys had some words
about some spring up in the mountains. All
foolishness—nobody had any real title to it
and everybody’s cattle watered there; so it
made no difference who claimed it. But they
got to shooting over it—silly fools! Both
gone now.”</p>

<p>“Nobody hurt?”</p>

<p>“Dah!” said Ducky scornfully. “Well,
how about that answer?”</p>

<p>Neighbor looked at his own toes with
painstaking speculative interest. To assist
the process he cocked his head on one side
and screwed his mouth up. At last he
glanced over at Ducky.</p>

<p>“I know a lot if I could only think of it,”
he announced plaintively. With a thoughtful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
face and apparently without his own
knowledge, he broke into song, with a gay,
lilting voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>Here I am, a-comin’ on the run—</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Best durn cowboy ’at ever pulled a gun!</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Hi-yi-yi-yippy; yippy-yi-yi-yi!</i></div>
<div class="indent"><i>Hi-yi-yi-yippy; yippy-yea!</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Ducky sniffed.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you learn a tune if you want
to sing?”</p>

<p>Neighbor looked round with puckered
eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, I ain’t singin’—not exactly!” he
answered dreamily. “I’m thinkin’—thinkin’
about your troubles and how to make ’em all
come out right in the next number. I’ve got
a two-story mind, you see. One of ’em is
diggin’ away for you, hard, while the other
one is singin’, foot-loose, or talking to you.
Me and the real serious-mind, we’re studyin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
right now; we don’t hardly sense what I’m
sayin’ to you. And that’s a real nice tune
too. I don’t like to have you make fun of
that tune. That’s a saddle song. That tune
goes to a trotting horse. You try it.”</p>

<p>“Why, so it does!” said Ducky after a
brief experiment.</p>

<p>“Can you make your fingers go gallop-y?
Well, do it, and I’ll show you another. But
don’t talk to me. I’m thinking fine and close,
like walkin’ a rope; and you’ll throw me off.”</p>

<p>So Ducky made his fingers go gallop-y and
Neighbor kept time to it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>Percival Pulcifer Peterkin Pool,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Cloaked and mittened and ready for school;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Cloaked and muffled and gloved and spurred.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Gee! Wasn’t Peter a wise old bird?</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Any more?” demanded Ducky, highly
diverted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“Yes; here’s a pacing tune. They say,”
added Neighbor absently, “they say, back
in Maryland and Virginia, that old King
James Fifth wrote this song—allowing for
some expurgating and change o’ names—Albuquerque
for Edinburgh—to give it local

<p>Here Neighbor brought his tilted chair
back to level, removed his clasped hands
from the back of his head, and shook off
his dreamy expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Well, I guess I’ll have to give it up for
this time,” he sighed.</p>

<p>“Yah!” said Ducky, grinning. “A pish
and three long tushes! You big stiff! I
thought you were going to tell me money,
money, who’s got the money? and where
Uncle Roger plucked it in the first place.
Little Ducky, he sticks to his first guess—mines—and
counterfeiting, for place.”</p>

<p>“Where he got it? Where—— My
poor, poor boy!” said Neighbor. “My
poor misguided lamb, I wasn’t studying
on who’s got your uncle’s money; I was
figuring on a harder thing—and that’s how
you and me are going to get it. I know
where your uncle’s money is. I know it
was really cash money, too, and not property.
And I know how he got it!”</p>

<p>Ducky stared.</p>

<p>“Business of gasp!” he said. “Demonstrate!
Produce!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“Wait a minute!” said Neighbor, holding
up a warning hand. “How do you bate
your breath? If you know, do it!”</p>

<p>“She’s bated. Break it to me!”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you first and give you the reasons
afterward; it makes the reasons sound
so much more reasonable, that way.”</p>

<p>“‘You may fire when ready, Gridley!’”</p>

<p>“Hist!” said Neighbor, weird, shaky and
spook-eyed. “Listen to the evil old man of
Haunted Hill! Your uncle was the Man
Higher Up! He made his money backing
gambling hells! U-r-r-r-r-h! The men who
have now got that money-money are Beck,
Baca, Scanlon, Quinliven and Bennett! And
the men who are now going to get that
money-money—open another bottle, Ducky—are
Roger Olcott Drake, Second—Present!—and
Neighbor Jones—Present! But
how? How? How?”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">Chapter V</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ROGER DRAKE caught his breath.</p>

<p>“Sir, do you inhale it or do you
use a needle? Can you prove any of that?”</p>

<p>“Prove it!” returned Neighbor indignantly.
“I don’t have to prove it—I know it.
It’s just gemimini-mentally got to be that
way. There ain’t no proofs—the kind to
convince a jury of peers; but there’s no other
way to account for what’s happened, and,
if you’re not a natural-born peer, I can
show you.”</p>

<p>“Among the many beauties that add luster
to my character are an aptitude to be
shown and a simple willingness to try anything—once.
Go to it, old summit! Wise
me up!”</p>

<p>“Ver-ree well! Let us examine the simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
and jolly facts—well-known, but not to
you. Tavy Baca is abso-lute-ly the Big
Noise in Saragossa County—accent on loot.
Nominations and appointments f. o. b. for
cash with order. Special terms for convictions
and acquittals. Try our land-office decisions.
Small graft of all kinds. Corpses
to order in neat hardwood boxes. Very
Roycrofty. See us before trying elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Laying all juries aside, he’s a smart lawyer—Baca.
He might be immensely
wealthy, but every Mexican within a radius,
when he’s sick, lazy or in trouble, makes a
beeline for Baca and comes away with a
jingle in his pocket. It’s like packin’ water
in a sieve.</p>

<p>“Gambling, as perhaps you know, is completely
stamped out in New Mexico since
she joined the glorious sisterhood. Baca
would be getting a juicy rake-off from Beck’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
game. Or, since Baca was your uncle’s lawyer,
uncle made the necessary arrangements
himself, likely.”</p>

<p>“But how do you know my uncle was behind
Beck?”</p>

<p>“I don’t—that comes later. I am now
giving you known facts only, and you can
build for yourself wherever they’ll fit.</p>

<p>“Bennett owns a heap of other people’s
property. He began life by ruining Brown
and Almandares—take thy bill and write
down fifty—deliberately smashed ’em so he
could get the wreckage. As he began, he
kept on—a wrecker. He has no heart,
lungs, lights or liver. I knew Almandares;
and the good Lord never made a better man
than that old Mexican.</p>

<p>“Let me at once show you the impassable
gulf between Bennett and a common
cheat like Beck, or like Scanlon—blacklegs,
card sharps, flimflammers. With the Beck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
kind, you lose only what they win. The
Bennett kind gladly makes you lose ten dollars
so he can get one. To end with, Beck
and Scanlon showed a tenderness toward
you not wholly explained by your many
charms of face and form. It was magnificent,
but it was not poker. And there’s
where I first got the hunch.</p>

<p>“Having stolen the big bundle, they, or
either of them, felt a certain delicacy about
cheating you for your small change; so what
they won from you they won fair. But
banker Bennett, with his share put up in
moth balls, he’s so scared you might find
out and pry it away from him that he wants
to hire you killed!”</p>

<p>Ducky Drake made an impassioned remark.
It was a household word.</p>

<p>“What makes it a good deal worse,” added
Jones with exceeding bitterness, “is that
he picked on me to let the contracts to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>“Well, but——”</p>

<p>“But, nothing! That is one word I can’t
bear. He offered to cancel the mortgage on
my stuff if I’d expurgate you. That means
nearly two thousand perfectly good bucks.
Why? Would Bennett do that from civic
pride? Nary! He’s got a big bunch of
your money—that’s why. Is there any other
possible reason?”</p>

<p>“Mere as I am,” said Ducky, “I can see
that. There is not. But how does all this
involve the others? And what makes you
hook up my uncle with the kitty industry?”</p>

<p>“When a man loves money and not work;
when a man has run through three fortunes,
two of ’em his own; when he turns up with
a taxable income made in Saragossa County—how
did he make it? How can he make
it? Openly, in mines, sheep, cattle, storekeeping,
liquor or law. But, except for one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
cattle ranch, misses’ size, your uncle had no
business relations—openly.</p>

<p>“What kind of business is done secretly?
Business that is very profitable and not well
thought of; counterfeiting—smuggling—gambling.
This wasn’t smuggling—too far
from the border. Nor counterfeiting—else
he might have printed off enough to let him
live in New York. Also, it couldn’t possibly
be counterfeiting, because it was gambling.</p>

<p>“Now, Beck and Scanlon run the only
dens in Saragossa and at Ridgepole. Because
they are all involved, your uncle must
have been hooked up with gambling; and,
because your uncle was hooked up with gambling,
they’re all involved.”</p>

<p>Ducky looked dazed; with tolerable reason.</p>

<p>“Quinliven is involved bad and big and
sure. He offered to take your cattle for the
full number on the tally book. No cowman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
would do that. The calves on that
tally are sold, lost, strayed, stolen, eaten,
skinned, and gone with the wild bunch.
Quinnie, he wanted to get little Ducky out
of the country.</p>

<p>“That shooting scrape was all fake; so
you wouldn’t suspect him and Banker Bennett
of standin’ in. Real sincere people
don’t empty their guns and not hit anybody—it
ain’t respectable. But Bennett he intended
to make that water hole the explanation
of your bein’ found dead and promiscuous.
That’s what he proposed to me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goils, pinch me!”</p>

<p>“Baca is involved by being your uncle’s
lawyer, and yet not knowing how your uncle
extracted that nice little income from Saragossa
County; and by being your lawyer
and not finding out. And old Beck and
Scanlon are involved by their conscientious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
scruples in not wanting the last rag off your
back.”</p>

<p>Ducky remonstrated.</p>

<p>“Hi! You put that last in to make it easy—like
the Englishman who always added
‘and barks like a dog’ to all his riddles, to
make ’em harder. You’re throwing the long
arm of coincidence out of socket. It won’t
wash, my Angular-Saxon friend! You’re
a good old superdreadnought and the best
hand at a standing high guess I’ve ever seen—but
we can’t go to court waving any wild,
wet tale like that.”</p>

<p>“Court? Oh, Jemima! Who said court?
Let Tavy Baca pick the jury and you
couldn’t convict one of that push on his own
written confession. The right hunch is goin’
to be the best evidence, where we settle
this case—and that’s out of court.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to use force?”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I shouldn’t wish any pie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
Why, Ducky dear, some of that outfit would
lock horns with Julius K. Cæsar if he looked
ogle-eyed at ’em. Tavy Baca especially is
a cold proposition—the worst west of a
given point. Only one skunk in the firm.
That’s Bennett. No, sir; if you want to
touch that tainted money——”</p>

<p>“I do. Let me leave no chance for misapprehension.
I want to roll in it! I want
to puddle my paddies in it!”</p>

<p>“Then you’ve got to guess quick and guess
right and guess hard; you’ve got to mean
what you think, and dig in your toes when
you pray! To handle this contract you have
got to have the hunch, the punch, the pep
and the wallop!”</p>

<p>“But, even if you’re right——”</p>

<p>“If you say that again I’ll quit you!” declared
Jones indignantly.</p>

<p>“Don’t say dem crool woids to me!”
begged Ducky. “You’re horribly right——but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
where are you going to begin? It’s like
climbing a glass wall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no—not so bad as that! We have
one highly important circumstance in our
favor. They haven’t divided the spoils yet.
If they had they wouldn’t be trying to get
you out of the way. And when they do divide—about
this time look out for squalls;
for I judge that most of that cash was left
on deposit with Bennett. The hell-housekeepers
will have the rest—what they had
for the house roll when they heard that
Uncle Roger had cashed in, and what
they’ve won or lost since.</p>

<p>“When you came on and it became plain
that you didn’t know anything about your
uncle’s business, there they were! Bennett
couldn’t keep it all—the gamblers would
give the snap away unless they got their
share. They couldn’t get it all—Bennett
would tell you first.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>“Oh, my, my! Birds in their little nests
should not fall out!”</p>

<p>Jones ignored the interruption.</p>

<p>“Baca and Quinliven horned in too—they
each want a slice; but Bennett won’t let it
out of his hands till you go home. He’s
afraid you’ll find instructions from your uncle
or some sort of a statement.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Roger knew, in a vague, general
way, that men died; but he thought that was
only other people—people in the papers,”
explained Roger. “And yet he must have
kept a pass book, receipts—something to
show for his deposits.”</p>

<p>“Exactly! Beck and Baca, between them,
have got the pass book, and hold it over
Bennett’s head for a club, likely. That’s
real funny. Bennett’s the one that’s taken
all the risks, this load. Generally it’s somebody
else that takes the chances, while Bennett
gets the profit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“Well! You certainly are a wise old
fowl!” said Roger with explosive emphasis.</p>

<p>“If your uncle had trusted him, I think,
maybe, Quinliven might have come across—I
judge he would. I reckon Quinnie, old
boy, was just uncle’s blind; but he guessed
something and butted in to blackmail the
blackmailers. To make it nice and pleasant
all round, him and Baca will be wanting
the gamesters to throw the house roll into
the pool along with the rest, and then split it
all up, even Stephen. I would right much
admire to witness the executive session of
that firm when they declare the final dividend!”
said Neighbor with a chuckle. Then
his brow clouded.</p>

<p>“But I can’t. Because we’re going to get
it. To begin with, suppose you step round
and take Quinnie up on his offer for your
cattle. Stick out for cash. He hasn’t got it,
but he’ll make the others dig it up from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
the sinking fund. Right then that company
will begin to get a pain in the stumick-ache.
They’ll see you makin’ ready to go ’way and
they’ll all begin playing for position. You
hang to your cattle selling as though you
didn’t have another idea on earth.”</p>

<p>Neighbor Jones rose to go.</p>

<p>“And while you start that I’m going
round and throw the clutch of circumstance
into the high gear.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">Chapter VI</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the lobby of the Windsor Hotel, as
Neighbor Jones came down the stairs,
Mr. Octaviano Baca chatted with a little
knot of guests. A well-set-up man, tall and
strong, with a dark, intelligent face marred
and pitted by smallpox but still pleasing, he
carried his two score years with the ease of
twenty. A gay man, a friendly man, his
manner was suave and easy; his dress, place
considered, rigorously correct—frock coat,
top hat, stick, gloves and gun. The gun
was covered, not concealed, by the coat; a
chivalrous concession to the law, of which
he was so much an ornament.</p>

<p>Baca was born to riches, and born to the
leadership of the clans. He had brains in
his own right; but it was his entire and often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
proved willingness to waive any advantage
and to discuss any moot point with that gun
which had won him admiration from the
many and forgiveness from the few.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones sank into a quiet chair and
read the newspapers. When Mr. Baca,
after several false starts, left his friends and
went out on the street, Mr. Jones rose and
followed him. Mr. Baca turned in at Beck’s
place, Jones behind him.</p>

<p>Gambling was completely eliminated in
Saragossa, but the saloon was in high favor
legally; so Beck and Scanlon kept a saloon
openly on the ground floor. The poker
rooms and the crap, monte, roulette and
faro layouts were upstairs. Their existence
was a profound secret. No stranger could
find the gambling den in Saragossa without
asking somebody—any one would do; unless,
indeed, he heard, as he passed, the whir of
the ivory ball or the clicking of chips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>Baca, with a nod and a smile for the bar,
passed on to join a laughing crowd behind,
where two native boys were enjoying a bout
with the gloves. Neighbor leaned on the
bar. The partners were ill matched. Beck
was tall, portly and, except for a conscientious,
professional smile, of a severe countenance,
blond, florid and flaxen. Scanlon was
a slender wisp of a blue-eyed Irishman, dried
up, wizened and silent.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said Neighbor jovially, “I
got to go back to the hills and grow a new
fleece. Till then, you’ve lost my game.
Sorry.”</p>

<p>Beck frowned.</p>

<p>“I hate to see a good fellow go bust. If
boys like you had plenty of money I
wouldn’t never have to work. Well, hurry
on back! And come straight here the first
night, before you waste any on clothes and
saddles and stuff.” He lowered his voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
for Neighbor’s ears. “Say, if you’re short,
you know—hotel bills, and so on—come
round.” He jerked a confidential thumb at
the house safe.</p>

<p>“Not so bad as that!” laughed Neighbor.
“But you want to sharpen your shears
up. They pulled a little this time.” He
passed on to the circle round the boxers.</p>

<p>It was late dusk when, after certain sociable
beverages, Mr. Baca bethought himself
of supper and started homeward. As
he swung along the sidewalk Mr. Jones was
close behind. Mr. Baca took the first turn
to the left: Mr. Jones took the first turn
to the left. Mr. Baca cut across the Park:
Mr. Jones also cut across the Park, now
almost at his quarry’s heels. Mr. Baca
wheeled.</p>

<p>“Did you wish to speak with me?”</p>

<p>Neighbor came forward, with an air of
relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“Why—er—not exactly; but I’d just as
lief as not. And it’ll be easier for me, now
it’s getting so dark. You see,” he said confidentially,
“I’m shadowing you!”</p>

<p>“You’re—what?”</p>

<p>“Shadowing you. You seemed to have
plenty of money; and I thought,” said
Neighbor hopefully, “that I might catch you
doing something wrong and blackmail you.”</p>

<p>“Are you trying to break into jail?” demanded
Baca sharply. “You are either intoxicated
or mentally deficient. In either
case——”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Neighbor soothingly.
“I’m not drunk. I really need the money.”</p>

<p>“Except that I doubt your sanity,” said
the outraged lawyer, “I’d make you regret
this bitterly. Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>“Sure! You’re Tavy Baca—Boss, Prosecuting
Attorney and two-gun man. And
please don’t talk that way about me,” Neighbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
pleaded in an injured voice. “It makes
me feel bad. You wouldn’t like it yourself.
Don’t you know me? I’m not insane. I’m
Jones—Neighbor Jones. I’ve been bucking
the poker game at Beck’s. But there—you
don’t know about the poker game, of course—you
being Prosecuting Attorney and all.”</p>

<p>“See here!” said Baca with a dull, ugly
note, “if you’re looking for trouble you can
get enough for a mess!”</p>

<p>“Not trouble—money!”</p>

<p>“I warn you now,” Baca advised. “Do
not follow me another step. I’m going.”</p>

<p>Jones burst into joyous laughter with so
free and unfeigned a note that Baca turned
again.</p>

<p>“Come!” cried Jones. “I know what you
think I’m going to say—that before I started
I left a sealed envelope with a friend and
told him if I didn’t come back by X o’clock
to break the seal and be guided by the contents—that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
what you thought I’d say. But
you’re wrong!” Unhesitatingly he took the
few steps separating him from that silent,
angry figure in the starlight. “Nobody
knows what I’m up to but you and me and
God, and you’re not right sure. So don’t
waste any more breath on warnings. I’m
warned—and you are!”</p>

<p>Without a word Baca turned at right angles
to his homeward course, and led the
way swiftly up the dark and steep street
to a dark and silent quarter of the Mexican
suburb. Toward the street, these old adobe
homes presented a blank wall; windows, and
all doors save one, fronting on the inclosed
<i>patio</i>.</p>

<p>“It’s like this,” said Jones cheerfully,
pressing along the narrow way a yard behind:
“I had a nice little bunch of cows—nigh
onto two hundred—out in the Monuments.
And Bennett, he was projecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
about like a roarin’ lion out there; and he
says: ‘Jones, why don’t you buy the Bar
Nothing brand?’ ‘No money,’ says I.... I
say, Baca, don’t go so fast! This
ain’t no Marathon! Lonesome, shivery
place, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>The silent figure walked still swifter.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, then! ‘I’ll lend you the
money,’ says Bennett, ‘an’ take a mortgage
on both brands.’ ‘There’ll come a drought,’
says I, ‘and them cattle will lay down and
die on me, a lot of ’em; and I’ll find myself
in a fix.’ And he did, and they did, and
I did.”</p>

<p>No word from Baca. In the black
shadow of the dark unlighted houses he
passed swiftly and unhesitatingly. Jones
continued:</p>

<p>“Since that I paid him all but eighteen
hundred-odd; and now the mortgage comes
due pretty sudden, and I stand to lose both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
brands.... Say, Baca, where’re you takin’
me to? Some gang of thugs? You can do
that all right—but I’ll get you first and I’ll
get you hard, and I’ll get you sure! Don’t
make any mistake!”</p>

<p>Baca gave way to his feelings.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother!” he said, and stopped, irresolute.</p>

<p>“What do you mean anyway, actin’ the
way you do?” demanded Jones, mopping his
forehead. “Wouldn’t it sound silly, if I lay
a-dyin’, for you to threaten me with jail and
shootin’ and law? They’d sound real futile,
wouldn’t they? Well, I’m dying right now.
I’ve been a long time at it; but there ain’t
no cure for what ails me but death. I refer,
of course, to the malady of living.”</p>

<p>“Damn your eyes!” cried the exasperated
King of Saragossa; and he began rapidly to
retrace his steps.</p>

<p>“And so,” continued the dying man, keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
pace, “I don’t never back up. When I
start out to blackmail a man he might just
as well be nice about it, ’cause I’m going to
blackmail him.”</p>

<p>Despite himself, Baca had to laugh.</p>

<p>“What are you going to blackmail me
for?”</p>

<p>“About two thousand,” said Jones.</p>

<p>“But what have I done?”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, man!” said Jones blankly.
“I don’t know!”</p>

<p>“Come!” said Baca, and clapped his persecutor
on the back. “I like a brave man,
even if he is a damned fool! Come home
to supper with me. I’ve got a little bachelor
establishment beyond the Park, with an old
Mexican <i>hombre</i> who can give you the best
meal in town.”</p>

<p>“You’re on! And after supper, then we
can fix up that mortgage, can’t we? I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
to specify that now, so I can eat your salt
without prejudice.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“And now,” said Baca, replenishing his
guest’s wine-glass, “about the blackmail. Of
what particular misdeed do you accuse me?”</p>

<p>“When you asked me to supper,” said
Jones thoughtfully, “you virtually admitted
there was something. You see that? But
I don’t like to intrude on your private affairs—to
butt in, as we say in Harvard.”</p>

<p>The host fixed keen eyes on him.</p>

<p>“As we say in Harvard? Yes,” he
purred. “Go on!”</p>

<p>“It is very distasteful to me. Instead of
me naming your crime-or crimes—why
could you not beg me to accept a suitable
sum as a recognition of my good taste? Just
as you please! It’s up to you.”</p>

<p>“As we say in Harvard!” suggested Baca<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
lightly, lifting his brows with another piercing
look.</p>

<p>“As we say in Harvard,” agreed Jones.
“Any sum, so long as it comes to exactly two
thousand. Or, you might use your influence
to get Bennett to cancel my mortgage—that
would be the same thing. He offered to
cancel it once this afternoon—on a condition.”</p>

<p>“And that condition?”</p>

<p>“Was not acceptable. It betrayed too
plainly the influence—the style, we might
say—of the James brothers.”</p>

<p>“William and Henry?”</p>

<p>“Jesse and Frank. Man, dear,” said
Neighbor with sudden, vehement bitterness,
“you and me, we’re no great shakes. You’re
goin’ to rob young Drake and I’m going to
take hush money for it; but this man Bennett
is a stinking, rancid, gray-headed old synonym.
He is so scared he won’t be happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
till he gets that boy killed. If I was as big
a coward as that, durned if I’d steal at all!”</p>

<p>Baca struck the table sharply; splotches of
angry red flamed in his cheeks.</p>

<p>“And I told him I wouldn’t stand for it!
Damn him! Look here, Jones, you ought
to be boiled in oil for your stupefying insolence;
but, just to punish him, I’ll make Bennett
pay your price. It will be like drawing
teeth; give me time.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">Chapter VII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE rain drenched in long shudders.
Here and there a late lamp blurred
dimly at a pane; high-posted street lamps,
at unequal and ineffectual distances, glowed
red through the slant lines of rain, reflected
faintly from puddle and gutter at their feet.
Alone, bent, boring into the storm, Martin
Bennett shouldered his way to Baca’s door
under the rushing night.</p>

<p>A gush of yellow struck across the dark—the
door opened at his first summons; he was
waited for. The master of the house helped
him from his raincoat and ushered him
through crimson portières into a warm and
lighted room. Three men sat before an
open fire, where a table gleamed with glasses
and bottles. There were two other doors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
hung, like the first, with warm, bright colors,
reflecting and tingeing the light from fire
and lamp—a cheerful contrast to the raw,
bleak night outside.</p>

<p>Here the good cheer ceased. The three
faces, as they turned to scowl at the newcomer,
were sullen, distrustful and lowering.</p>

<p>Despite the raincoat, Bennett was sodden
to his knees; his hands and face and feet were
soaked and streaming. No friendly voice
arose to remark on his plight; an ominous
silence had prevailed since the street door
had opened to him. He bent shivering to
the fire. With no word the host filled and
brought to him a stiff glass of liquor. Bennett
drained it eagerly and a little color crept
back into his pinched features.</p>

<p>Owen Quinliven broke silence then, with a
growl deep in his throat.</p>

<p>“Thought you’d better come, eh?” His
mustached lip bristled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>“The storm was so bad. I thought it
might let up after a while,” said Bennett
miserably.</p>

<p>“Don’t make that an excuse,” said Beck
with a cold sneer. “You might have slipped
over to our place, a short block; or you
could have had us meet you at your own
office.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen! Gentlemen!” expostulated
Baca, with a curling lip. “You do not understand.
Mr. Bennett has his position to
think of. Mr. Bennett is highly respectable.
He could not let it be known that he had
traffic with professional gamblers like Mr.
Beck and the estimable Scanlon.” He bowed
ironically; the estimable Scanlon rolled a
slow, wicked little eye, and Baca’s cheek
twitched as he went on: “I say nothing,
as you observe, of myself or of our worthy
friend Quinliven, who, as I perceive, is in a
very bad temper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>Quinliven glowered at the speaker like a
baited bull. He was a huge, burly man with
a shaggy, brindled head, a bull neck, a russet
face knotted with hard red lumps, and
small, fiery, amber-colored eyes under a thick
tangle of bushy brows. The veins swelled
in his neck as he answered.</p>

<p>“Well, he’ll have some traffic with me,
and do it quick! Here I’ve talked young
Drake into selling out and going home; I’m
giving him twenty-five hundred dollars too
much, standin’ the loss out of my share—and
me not getting a full share at all! All I
get is the cattle, while the rest of you pull
down nearly twelve thousand apiece, net
cash. That part is all right though. That’s
my own proposition. I don’t begrudge the
little extra money to the boy, and I want
him to get away from here for his own sake
as well as for mine. This crawling, slimy
Bennett thing is bound to have that boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
killed.” He glared at the steaming banker
by the fire. “I don’t see how that man got
by with it so long. He wouldn’t last long
on the range. And now, after I’ve made the
trade, Bennett hems and haws, and hangs
fire about giving up the money.”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand,” protested the
wretched banker. “You’ll get your share;
but it would inconvenience me dreadfully to
take that amount of money immediately
from a little private bank like mine. In
ninety days, or even sixty, I can so adjust
my affairs as to settle with all of you.”</p>

<p>“My heart bleeds for you,” said Beck
sympathetically. “For I’m going to inconvenience
you a heap more. You’ll adjust
your affairs in less than ninety hours, or
even sixty. I’ve been fooled with long
enough. That pass book calls for a little
over forty-six thousand dollars. We expected
to get half. Instead we’ve got to split<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
it four ways. Young Drake is going and I
want my split right now.”</p>

<p>“What about me?” cried the banker in
wild and desperate indignation. “What do
I get? Barely a fourth! And you two
have Drake’s money already—heaven knows
how much!”</p>

<p>“Heaven don’t,” said Beck.</p>

<p>“But do I get any of that?” shouted the
outraged banker.</p>

<p>“You do not,” returned Beck. “In the first
place, the men are different. You stepped
out of your class when you started to mingle
with the likes of us. Why should you
bother to rob a perfect stranger anyhow?
And you with money corded up! I don’t
understand it.”</p>

<p>“Bennett!” cried the ranchman, “if I stood
in your shoes, before I’d allow any man to
use me like we’re using you, I’d go to Drake
and give that money up. I’d say: ‘Young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
fellow, I meant to rob you; but my conscience
troubles me, and so do my feet.’
You ain’t got the gall, and you’re too big
a hog. I dare you to!”</p>

<p>“And in the next place,” continued the
complacent gambler, ignoring the interruption,
“there’s not one scrap of paper to connect
our money with Old Drake. Part of
it is ours anyhow, that we’ve made honestly——”</p>

<p>“At poker,” corrected Scanlon.</p>

<p>“At poker, I should say. But we’ve got
your receipts, Mr. Banker. That’s what
makes you squirm! And they’re where you
can’t get ’em; so it won’t do you any good
to get any of us murdered, the way you tried
to do that boy.”</p>

<p>“He tried it again yesterday,” interposed
Baca softly.</p>

<p>Quinliven brought his heavy hand crashing
down on the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“You damned coward! I told you to
drop that!” His red mustache prickled
fiercely; above his eyes the red tufts knotted
to bunches. He glanced round at his fellows.
“Look here; there’s no damn sense
in hurting that kid, the way things stand.
If Drake gets killed over this I’m going to
see that Bennett swings for it if I have to
swing with him—the yellow cur!”</p>

<p>The banker shriveled under his look.</p>

<p>“Your sentiments do you vast credit,” observed
Baca suavely. “I concur most heartily.
But, my good fellow, why bawl your
remarks?” He accompanied the query with
a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>Scanlon raised his head to watch. The
ranchman’s fingers worked and quivered; for
a moment it seemed as though he would leap
on his tormentor; but he settled back.</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” said Scanlon.</p>

<p>Then, noting that Beck did not commit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
himself to this self-denying ordinance, he
filled a glass with wine and, as he drank it,
observed his partner narrowly from the tail
of his eye.</p>

<p>“You may rest easy, Mr. Quinliven,” observed
Baca, straddling with his back to the
fire and his hands to the blaze. “There will
be no need for you to carry out your chivalrous
intention. I assure you that while I
live I am perfectly capable of selecting a
jury that will hang Mr. Bennett without the
disastrous concomitant you mention; and I
shall take great pleasure in doing so should
need arise. I should hate to see you hanged,
Quinliven—I should indeed! You distress
me! But I fear——” He left the sentence
unfinished, shaking his head sorrowfully.
“Mr. Bennett, I am sure, will bear himself
to conform with our wishes. However, I
find myself in full accord with Mr. Bennett
in the matter of the moneys now in the hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
of Messrs. Beck and Scanlon, and wrongfully
withheld from our little pool.”</p>

<p>“That will be a-plenty,” said Beck. “For
fear of mistakes I will now declare myself.
We admit that we have a bundle of
the Drake money and we announce that we
are going to keep it. How much, is nobody’s
business but our own. In consideration
of that fact, however, the two of us lay
claim to only one full share of the Drake
deposit. That gives us twelve thousand;
Bennett as much; the Honorable Prosecuting
Attorney the same; the Double Dee
brand to Quinliven. That’s final!”</p>

<p>“I suppose you know, Mr. Beck,” said
Baca, cupping his chin, “your little joint
can be closed any time I lift a finger?”</p>

<p>“Baca,” said Scanlon with level eyes,
“you’ll close nawthin’! We bought protection
from you. We’ll get what we bought.
When you feel any doubts comin’ on, don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
talk to Beck about it. Talk to me! And,”
he added with venomous intensity, “one
more word about any divvy on our poker
roll and that pass book goes to Ducky
Drake!” He tapped his breast. “I’ve got
the pass book—not Beck.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” said Baca indulgently,
“have your own way. Far be it from me
to question any gentleman’s ultimatum, and
so, perhaps, bring a discordant note into our
charming evening. Let us pass on to the
next subject. Is everybody happy? No!
Mr. Bennett is not happy. Mr. Bennett is a
very able man, as we all know—exemplar
to the young—a rich man, merchant prince,
and all that. And yet we can quite understand
that he may be temporarily embarrassed
for actual cash. I, for one, am willing
to allow him a reasonable time. He
cannot hide his real estate; so we shall be
taking no risks. Doubtless we can stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
off young Drake for the price of his cattle
by giving him good security.”</p>

<p>The silent Scanlon leaped up and snarled
in unimaginable ferocity.</p>

<p>“If there’s any more shilly-shally there’ll
be a Standing Room Only sign on the gates
of hell and the devil sending out a hurry-up
call for the police!” His voice swelled in
breathless crescendo. “I’m sick of you—the
whole pack and pilin’! I want to get so
far away from here it’ll take nine dollars
to send me a postcard; so far east they’ll
give me change for a cent; so far north the
sun don’t go down till after dark.” His
eyes were ablaze with blistering scorn.
“Gawd! Look at yourselves! Quinliven—the
honorable, high-minded, grave-robbing
pardner——”</p>

<p>“Here!” bellowed Quinliven savagely.
“I came through with the cattle, straight as
a die! That’s as far as I was any pardner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
of Drake’s. You don’t know how that
man treated me! It wasn’t only me doing
all the work—but his cold, sneering, overbearing——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, you polled Angus bull!” yelled
Scanlon with a howl of joyous truculence.
“And Bennett—faugh! P-t-t-h!”</p>

<p>Scanlon spat in the fire, and wheeled on
the other gambler. Beck’s face was black
with concentrated hate. The little man
pointed a taunting finger.</p>

<p>“Look at Beck!” he jeered. “Guess what
he knows I think of ’im! And I know him—he’s
me pardner! Fish mouth and mackerel
eye—— Yah! And all three of you
knuckle down to Baca! Year after year
you let yourselves be bullyragged, browbeaten,
lorded over by a jury-packing, witness-bribing
shyster—a grafter, a crook, a
dirty Mexican——”</p>

<p>Without hesitation or change of countenance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
Baca walked across the open space
toward him.</p>

<p>“Not one step more!” said Scanlon.</p>

<p>Baca stopped in his tracks.</p>

<p>“You nervy little runt,” he said, half in
admiration, “you mean it! Well, I mean
this, too. If I’m a crook—and there is
much in favor of that contention—it is because
my personal inclination lies that way,
and not in the least because of my Mexican
blood. I am quite clear on that point.
Leave out the part about the dirty Mexican
and I don’t take that other step. Otherwise,
I step! Choose!”</p>

<p>“I withdraw the Mexican!” said Scanlon
ungrudgingly. “Dod! I believe you’re
the best of the rotten bunch!”</p>

<p>“Go on, then: ‘Grafter, crook’——”
prompted Baca.</p>

<p>“Why—er—really!” stammered Scanlon.
Then he brightened. “‘There has been so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
much said, and, on the whole, so well said,’”
he beamed, canting his head on one side
with a flat, oily smile, “‘that I will not further
detain you.’”</p>

<p>He seated himself, with a toothy, self-satisfied
expression; but the allusion was lost
on all except the delighted Baca.</p>

<p>In glum silence, Quinliven reached for a
bottle and glared at the little Irishman, who
smiled evilly back at him.</p>

<p>“There is one more point,” observed
Baca in his best courtroom manner, “on
which I touch with a certain delicacy and,
as it were, with hesitation. I am reluctant
to grieve further a spirit already distressed;
but the fact is, gentlemen, our impulsive
friend here”—he laid a gentle hand on Bennett’s
shoulder and Bennett squeaked—“undertook
yesterday to employ this man Jones—Neighbor
Jones—to murder our friend
Drake. I take this most unkindly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>He teetered on his tiptoes; he twirled his
eyeglasses; his hand made a pleasant jingle
with key ring and coin; his face expressed
a keen sense of well-being and social benevolence.</p>

<p>“As a matter of abstract principle, even
before we had learned to love our young
friend Drake, we decided that such a step
was unnecessary and inexpedient; and so
informed Mr. Bennett. But the idea of
slaying Mr. Drake seems to have become
an obsession with Mr. Bennett—or, as English
Ben would put it, a fad. As English
Ben would say, again, Mr. Bennett is a
beastly blighter.”</p>

<p>He adjusted the eyeglasses and beamed
round on his cowed and sullen confederates,
goaded, for his delight, to madness
and desperation; and on the one uncowed
co-devil, the mordant and cynical Scanlon.</p>

<p>“Our young Eastern friend has endeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
himself to our hearts. I do not exaggerate
when I say that we feel quite an avuncular
interest in his fortunes. We are deeply hurt
by Mr. Bennett’s persistence; but let us not
be severe. In this case retribution has been,
as we might say, automatic, for the man
Jones, by some means, has acquired an inkling
of the posture in which our affairs lie
in the little matter of the Drake estate;
though I believe he suspects only Bennett and
myself. Bennett, I judge, has talked too
much. And—such is the wickedness and
perfidy of the human mind—the man Jones
makes a shameless demand on us for two
thousand dollars, money current with the
merchant, as the price of silence. Alas, that
such things can be!”</p>

<p>His hands, now deep in his trousers pockets,
expressed a lively abhorrence for the
perfidy of the man Jones.</p>

<p>“This iniquitous demand is no better than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
blackmail and might be resisted in our
courts of justice; but, inasmuch as Mr.
Bennett’s sanguinary disposition has brought
on us this fresh complication, would it not
be well to permit Mr. Bennett to pay this
two thousand from his private pocket? I
pause for a reply.”</p>

<p>Bennett let out a screech between a howl
and a shriek.</p>

<p>“This is infamous! You’re robbing me!
Oh, why did I ever have dealings with such
desperadoes?”</p>

<p>“Why, indeed?” said Baca tranquilly. “I
think, if you will permit me to criticize, that
was a mistake in judgment on your part,
Mr. Bennett. You have not the temperament
for it.”</p>

<p>“He pays!” said Scanlon, gloating.</p>

<p>“He pays!” echoed the rancher.</p>

<p>“You’re robbing me!” Bennett crumpled
to a wailing heap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“We’re not, ye black scut!” snapped
Scanlon, perking the unfortunate banker upright
by the collar. “But we will! We’re
now holding to the exact bargain we proposed
and you agreed to; but if ever little
Mickey S. has need or desire av the red,
red gold or the green, green greenback, ’tis
back here he will come to you. May Gawd
have mercy on your soul! Sit up, ye spineless
jellyfish—sit up!”</p>

<p>Beck, sitting mute in a cold fury of hate,
raised his eyes.</p>

<p>“This Neighbor Jones—I had a letter
about him to-day. He’s caught on, someway,
that we’ve been workin’ him over in
the shop; and he’s layin’ for us, I guess.
That big lump that called himself the Kansas
City Kid—’twas him that wrote the letter.
Jones accused him of cheating and
drove him out of town—took his gun, made
him leave his clothes, and hike. That’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
dangerous man, Baca. Now I think of it,
young Drake quit us at the same time.
Jones told him our game was crooked,
likely.”</p>

<p>“Them two was together all this forenoon—I
seen ’em,” contributed Quinliven.
“Is Jones maybe fixing to give you the double
cross?”</p>

<p>Baca considered with contracted brow.</p>

<p>“Possibly; but not necessarily so,” he said.
“Drake agreed to sell last night. Perhaps
he merely got wise to himself—to use his
own phrase—and decided to sell out and go
home while the going was good. Jones
would be his natural associate, the two having
been bucking the game together; but
Jones expects to get clear of his debt by
sticking to me. He could gain nothing by
telling Drake. We are too powerful. He
knows there is no way to make us disgorge—disgorge
is the word, I think, in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
connection. I find Jones most amusing, myself.
If he wearies me——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you figure Jones for any easy
mark,” warned Scanlon. “If he tries to
hand us something—look out! He is a bad
actor.”</p>

<p>“Leave him to me,” said Baca with a
tightening of the lips. “I’ll take measures
to improve his acting. Never mind Jones.
We have now satisfactorily adjusted the
preliminaries, have we not? It is established,
I believe, that Mr. Scanlon and myself
constitute a clear majority of this meeting.
Any objection? In that case, let us
now get down to the sad and sordid business
before us. It is the sense of the meeting,
as I take it, that Mr. Bennett shall bring
to this room, by ten o’clock to-morrow—no;
to-morrow is Sunday—by ten o’clock on
Monday, the purchase money for the Double
Dee cattle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Oh-h!” It was a mournful howl, a
dog’s hopeless plaint to the moon; emitted,
however, by one of the gentlemen present.</p>

<p>“Objection overruled. You will, also,
Mr. Bennett, provide twenty-four thousand
dollars to satisfy the other equities, here
held in the Drake estate.”</p>

<p>Scanlon held up a finger.</p>

<p>“Cash, you moind! No checks or drafts,
to be headed off. Coin or greenbacks! I
will not be chipracked by this slippery ould
man. He is the human greased pig.”</p>

<p>By a prodigious effort Bennett pulled
himself together; his face was very pale.</p>

<p>“To provide that much cash, without
warning, is impossible. I should have nothing
left to do the bank’s business with; in
fact, I have not half that amount of actual
cash in the safe.”</p>

<p>He stood up and grasped the back of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
chair—his knuckles were white as he
gripped; his voice grew firmer.</p>

<p>“I’ll be open with you, gentlemen. I am
too much extended; I am bitterly cramped
for ready money. Give me time to turn
round; don’t force me to take this money
out of the business now. Once let the ordinary
loans be refused to a few customers;
let the rumor of it go abroad; let my Eastern
creditors once hear of it—and I must
inevitably stand a heavy loss. They will demand
immediate payment, and that I cannot
make without sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“What would your creditors think if they
knew what we know?” answered Beck.
“You’ll make your sacrifice right now, within
forty-eight hours, for your preferred creditors,
here present.”</p>

<p>“Baca! I appeal to you. Help me! I’ll
be honest. To pay out this sum will not
ruin me, but it’ll cripple me so that it may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
take me years to recover. At the very best
I shall lose far more than the pitiful remnant
of the Drake money you leave me.
Give me time to turn round! Give me thirty
days!”</p>

<p>“Thirty hours,” said Beck; “Monday
morning.”</p>

<p>“I tell you it will cost me two dollars for
every one I pay over to you now,” the
banker pleaded. “Let me give you certificates
of deposit.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you gave Drake!” said
Scanlon.</p>

<p>For the first time in the somber silence
that followed they heard the loud clock on
the mantel—tick, tock—tick, tock—tick,
tock!</p>

<p>Baca spoke at last slowly and thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Bennett, you have good standard securities
in the El Paso National, pledged for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
comparatively small amount, as I happen to
know. You can sell them by wire and have
the money here by the last train on Monday.
That’s what you’d better do. Personally
I am not inclined——”</p>

<p>“Here is too much talk,” said Scanlon.
“Cash or smash!”</p>

<p>Bennett threw up his hand in a gesture
of despair.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it on Monday. Let me go
home.”</p>

<p>“There now! I knew you would do the
right thing if we forced you to!” Baca went
to the window. “It is not raining hard; so
perhaps you had better go home, as you
suggest, Mr. Bennett. You seem fatigued.
But the rest of you will stay with me for
the night, I trust. I have good beds; here
is wine and fire; and we can have a quiet
rubber. No stakes, of course.” He twisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
his mouth and cocked an eyebrow at
Beck.</p>

<p>“I’m gone!” announced Beck. He
brushed by without a glance at the others,
jerked his hat and slicker from the rack,
and flung out into the night.</p>

<p>“Now who would suspect the urbane and
lovable Beck of being so sensitive?” asked
Baca, rocking on his feet. “We shall not
have our whist game after all. You two
will stay, however? Yes? That’s good!”
said the host. “Have a glass of wine before
you go, Bennett. No? Let me help
you on with your raincoat, then. You have
your rubbers?” He held the door open.
“Good-night!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>

<h3 class="nobreak">Chapter VIII</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BECK did not take his way to his own
rooms despite the lateness of the
hour. He followed the street at his left,
the one that led to Bennett’s home. A little
later the door opened and Bennett took the
same path at a slower gait.</p>

<p>A head projected itself cautiously above
the adobe wall that fenced the Baca garden,
looked forth swiftly, and vanished. After
a few seconds the head appeared again, farther
away, where a lilac overhung the wall.
Screened by this background the head, with
the body appertaining thereunto, heaved,
scrambling over the wall, and followed, with
infinite caution, the way of the two transgressors,
keeping at a discreet distance behind
the slower one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>It was quite dark, though a few pale
stars glimmered through rushing clouds;
the rain was a mere drizzle. Head and
appurtenant body—the latter slickered and
bulky—paused to listen. They heard plainly
the plup of Bennett’s feet before them,
and sat resolutely down on the sloppy stone
walk. There was a swift unlacing of shoes,
a knotting of laces. Slinging the shoes
about the neck between them, they took up
the pursuit, swift and noiseless, slinking in
the deeper shadows, darting across the open
spaces, and ever creeping closer and closer—a
blacker darkness against the dark.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>When Bennett had passed through Baca’s
door, framed for an instant, black against
a glowing square of light, Beck had been
watching from far down the street. Assured
that Bennett was coming, he then
walked on swiftly for two or three blocks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
Where a long row of cottonwoods made
dark the way, he waited in the shadows. He
heard the slow steps of his approaching victim,
noted their feebleness, and waited impatiently
until Bennett passed his tree.</p>

<p>The gambler pounced on him; he crushed
his puffy hand over Bennett’s mouth.</p>

<p>“It’s me, Beck! If you make a sound,
damn you, I’ll kill you! Feel that gun at the
back of your neck?” He took his hand
away. “What’s the matter with you? You
old fool, can’t you stand up? I won’t hurt
you—unless you try to talk. If you say
just one word to me I’m going to kill you.
I mean it!” His speech was low and
guarded. “I’ve heard enough talk to-night
to do me quite some time. That Scanlon
and Baca—I’ll show them how to ride me!”</p>

<p>He peered up and down the deserted
street.</p>

<p>“Walk on, now! Here; take my arm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
you poor old fool! Let’s go down and inspect
your bank!”</p>

<p>Bennett gave a heart-rending groan; his
knees sagged, and he clung limply to his
captor’s arm.</p>

<p>“If it will make you feel any better,” said
Beck with a little note of comfort in his
voice, “I’m going to rob my own safe next.”</p>

<p>This assurance did not have the desired
effect. With many exhortations, slowly,
painfully, they negotiated the distance to the
Bennett headquarters in the old Almandares
Block.</p>

<p>With a strong hand on his collar and the
muzzle of a forty-four pressed between his
shoulder blades, the unfortunate banker
unlocked the door, threaded the long,
crowded aisles in the pitch dark, and came
at last to his private office. At his captor’s
command he lighted a single gas jet near
the safe; it made a wan and spectral light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
in the doleful place; in the corners of the
great room the shadows crowded and trampled.</p>

<p>With his shriveled face contorted in dumb
protest, with tears on his ash-pale cheeks, the
wretched man groped at the combination.
Strange thoughts must have passed through
his mind as he knelt there, delaying desperately,
hoping for the impossible.</p>

<p>Vainly, with a fiendish face, Beck urged
and threatened; still the shaking fingers fumbled,
without result. With a horrible snarl
the gambler clasped Bennett’s wrist, twisted
it up and back to the shoulder blades, and
pushed it violently forward. Stifling a shriek,
the tortured wretch pitched over on his face
and lay there groveling, gasping, his free
hand clawing at the boards of the floor.</p>

<p>The gambler raised him up, releasing the
pressure on the twisted arm; Bennett twirled
the knobs, the tumblers clicked, the bolts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
snicked from their sockets; the great door
swung open.</p>

<p>“Now the little doors and the drawers!”
Beck directed. He was sweating freely. For
a moment it had seemed that Bennett would
defy him at the last. “Don’t leave anything
locked on me! Man, the sweat’s just pouring
from you. That looks like a lot of
money, to me. There, I forgot one thing!
I saw one of those little electric flashlights
in your show window yesterday. I want it.
Lead me to it.”</p>

<p>After some delay in the dark the flashlight
was found. By its aid the robber compelled
his victim to search out and carry
a neat traveling bag, certain coiled ropes, two
silk handkerchiefs, and a round from a
loose stool; and drove him back to the office.</p>

<p>Here, heedless of voiceless protest and
despairing tears, he gagged the master of
the counting house with the silk handkerchiefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
and the chair round, and then, with
scientific precision, proceeded to bind him
hand and foot.</p>

<p>“There!” he said, after a final painstaking
inspection. “That’ll hold you a while!
It’s a pity you’re a bachelor. If you had a
family they might find you here to-morrow.
As it is I’m afraid you’ll have to wait till
Monday morning. If you’ll excuse me I’ll
turn out the gas now. Somebody might see
it. I can do my packing by the searchlight.”</p>

<p>He sized up the stacks of gold, thumbed
the bills, made a rough calculation, rolled
on the prisoner an eye dark with suspicion,
and remarked with great fervor, that he
would be damned—Oh! Oh! He packed
the money neatly in the bag. Then he
turned the flashlight on Bennett’s livid face—a
hopeless face, seared with greed and
fear and all the unlovely passions.</p>

<p>“Bennett, you’re the most contemptible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
liar God ever let live!” His voice rang
deep with scorn. “All that talk about your
bein’ broke—and here’s thirty-one thousand
and some dollars—not counting the chicken
feed, which I leave for you. Say, do you
know what I think?” He held the flashlight
closer to the quivering face. “I think
you’ve reached the end of your rope. I
think you’re about ready for a smash-up.
By jingo, that’s it! You’ve been speculating
deep or you never would have stolen
Drake’s deposit.</p>

<p>“It’s my notion that you intended to take
this little wad and skip for Old Mex—maybe
selling them El Paso securities before we
missed you. I beat you to it, old hand!
You can settle with my lovely companions
on Monday. I reckon they’ll be pretty sore,
too, after all that big talk they made—Scanlon
especially. We have about twenty-six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
thousand in our safe and I’m taking that.
Well, I gotta go. S’long!”</p>

<p>But he came back at once. Bennett could
not see his face; but the man’s voice, for
the first time since the hold-up, carried a
human note.</p>

<p>“I kind of hate it, too—you layin’ here
tied up this way all that time. It’s going
to be pretty tough. You’ll have to overlook
it, old man. There wasn’t any other way.
It was that or kill you. If it’ll make you
any easier in your mind you’ve got my dyin’
oath that I’d ’a’ killed you in a holy minute
if you hadn’t come through, or if you’d
’a’ made one wrong move. Bein’ tied up is
a lot better than being dead.” A new
thought struck him. “I’ve got it!” he cried
triumphantly. “Quick as I get to Juarez I’ll
wire somebody to let you go. That won’t
be so bad. I won’t waste a minute. Buck
up! I’m gone now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>Once in the open Beck trod with a jubilant
step. It was darker now and raining
steadily; the smell of dawn was in the air;
he quickened his pace. No sign of life was
on the street.</p>

<p>The gambler came to his place of business,
took out his key ring, and entered
noiselessly. He worked swiftly. A through
freight went south before daylight, stopping
at Saragossa for water; he would have time
to make it nicely. Very quickly the money
in the safe was stowed in his traveling bag.
There was a little silver in stacks. Though
the bag was quite heavy enough already—for
much of the money had been gold pieces—Beck
took the silver too.</p>

<p>Then a better thought came to him. He
counted out nine silver dollars and put them
back in the safe; he laid a blank check, face
down, on the floor of the safe, with a dollar
on each end like paper weights. And in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
slender lance of light cast by the electric
flash he penciled a brief note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dear Scanlon</i>: I am leaving you nine
dollars to send me a postcard.</p>
</div>

<p>He snapped out the flashlight, stuck it in
his pocket, and tiptoed to the front door,
laughing softly.</p>

<p>Man is the slave of habit. Outside Beck
turned to lock the door—a most illogical
thing to do. He placed the bag between his
feet, fumbled for the keyhole and inserted
the key. Then he stiffened. He felt the
cold muzzle of a gun against his temple,
and a gentle voice said:</p>

<p>“Let me carry your bag.”</p>

<p>Frozen with horror, the gambler felt a
hand remove his own gun and the flashlight.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” demanded the voice.
“Oh, I see—a searchlight! That’ll be nice.
Keep your hands right where they are!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
The hand felt for further weapons. “All
right!” said the voice. “Now open up and
we’ll go upstairs. You tote the baggage.
Close the door gently, please. March!”</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do; so Beck
marched.</p>

<p>“I may not do as good a job on you as you
did with Bennett,” said the voice apologetically;
“but I’ll fix you up some way. While
you was tyin’ Bennett up I raided the whole
durn neighborhood for clothesline. This’ll
be one awful grouchy town on wash-day!”</p>

<p>Beck’s scalp prickled with an agonizing
memory of Bennett’s ghastly face, as he had
seen it last; the hair began to rise. He
stopped on the stairs rebelliously.</p>

<p>“I wish you would yell once, or balk—or
something,” said the voice hopefully. “It’d
save me a heap o’ trouble—trussing you up.
G’wan, now!”</p>

<p>The gambler g’waned.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">Chapter IX</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE sky was washed clean; the sound
of church bells floated across the
sunny meadows; the winds were still, save
as a light and loitering air wandered by,
poignant with a spicy tang, the sweet alloy
of earth.</p>

<p>Listening to those peaceful bells, Mr.
Drake and Mr. Jones lolled at ease in the
modest hostelry favored by the latter gentleman,
and looked out on a freshened and
sparkling world. As the last echo died
away Mr. Drake resumed the conversation:</p>

<p>“I gotta hand it to you, Mr. Weisenheimer.
That’s a great bean of yours!
You’ve made your case. Uncle had money;
it’s gone; somebody’s got it; <i>x</i> is eager to
give too much for my brand; <i>y</i> offers an exorbitant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
price for my scalp; <i>z</i> is willing to
pay you to keep quiet. How long will it
take two men to dig two graves if the age
of the first man is twice that of the second
one? And who should have the custody of
the child? Perfectly simple!”</p>

<p>“But you can’t explain it any other way.”</p>

<p>“Hang it! I don’t want to explain it any
other way. You’re right—but you can’t go
ahead. Your wind-up is good; but can you
put it over? How do you propose to go
ahead about collecting? It reminds me of a
little passage in Shakespeare that my chum
sprung on the Frosh class in English. I
remember it because Kitty, the prof, was so
justly indignant:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“<i>Deep and dangerous,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>As full of peril and adventurous spirit</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>As to o’erwalk a current roaring loud</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>On the unsteadfast footing of a spear;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>If he fall in—good-night!</i>”</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>“It is widely believed,” replied Neighbor,
“that you cannot catch a weasel asleep; but
I think it can be done, with patience. Don’t
be in such a hurry—be calm!”</p>

<p>“I want you to know I can be as calm as
anybody when there’s anything to be calm
about,” retorted Ducky with some acerbity.
“It isn’t so much the money—not but what
I could use that to buy food with—but those
fellows are not doing me right.”</p>

<p>“There’s our one best chance,” said
Neighbor, more seriously than was his wont.
“They’re doing wrong. Doing right is as
easy as sticking a needle in the eye of a
camel; but to do wrong takes a steady, dead
lift. Every tendency and every fact pulls
against it like the force of gravity at four
<span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> I’m not particularly bitter against
my own dear little sins, but I do believe
that, in the long run, the way of the transgressor
is really hard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>There came a tap at the door; Mr. Jones
was wanted at the phone.</p>

<p>“Hello! This is Baca!” the telephone
said; and could Mr. Jones step up to the
house? It thought that matters might be
arranged. “<i>Immediatamente!</i>” said Mr.
Jones, and hung up.</p>

<p>“Now, Ducky,” he counseled, as they
walked uptown, “you notice close, and I’ll
show you some diplomacy. I’ll make Baca
commit himself so deep that it will amount
to a full confession. You still don’t quite
believe what you think. When I am done
with him you’ll have no doubts. That’s
your great trouble, son—you don’t think
hard enough. You don’t concentrate. You
will not give to the matter in hand the full
impact of your mind. You think straight
enough but you haven’t got the punch.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Baca lifted a sarcastic eyebrow at Ducky’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
presence and bent a questioning look on
Neighbor Jones, but showed them into the
curtained room of the previous night’s conference.
Refreshments were offered and declined.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Jones, if you are still of the
same mind to-morrow morning at ten o’clock
your mortgage will be released to you on
the terms you mentioned.”</p>

<p>Neighbor wore a shamefaced look. He
twiddled with his hat.</p>

<p>“Maybe I didn’t do just right about that,
Mr. Baca. I only wanted to draw you.”
He looked up and smiled. “You see, we
knew all the time that you fellows had
Drake’s money,” he said chattily. “My
proposition was to make you tip your hand—to
convince Mr. Ducky that my reasoning
was strictly O. K., if not logical.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baca received this rather staggering
communication point-blank but, aside from
a heightened color, bore up under it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
surprising spirit. Indeed, he seemed less
disconcerted than Ducky Drake.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the lawyer. “You don’t lose
much time in getting to the point, do you?
Your candor is most commendable, and it
shall be my endeavor to observe a like
frankness with you. It is better so. Deceit
and subterfuge are foreign to my disposition.
Though not anticipating this particular
turn of affairs, I have been forewarned
against you, Mr. Jones, and have made my
preparations accordingly. Felipe!”</p>

<p>One of the portières slid aside, revealing
a slim brown young man with a heavy revolver,
and a fat brown young man with a
rifle. At the other door the curtains parted
for a glimpse of an older Mexican with a
benign and philosophical face and a long
white beard. His armament consisted of
one double-barreled shotgun. All these men
wore appreciative grins, and all these weapons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
were accurately disposed to rake Mr.
Jones amidships.</p>

<p>“My executive staff!” announced the lawyer
urbanely.</p>

<p>Neighbor nodded to the staff. Fascinated
Ducky did the same.</p>

<p>“So pleased!” he murmured.</p>

<p>Baca paused for a moment to enjoy his
triumph. Then he waved his hand.</p>

<p>“That will do.” The portières slid together.</p>

<p>“I’m not scared,” explained Neighbor
Jones earnestly. “That noise you hear is
only my teeth chattering!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you punch!” Ducky drew a long
breath. “If I had three wishes I’d want
to be a puzzle picture—find Ducky Drake!”
Then he giggled. “‘Gee! Sumpin’ must ’a’
happened to Ole!’” he suggested lightly.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear of the old Texan’s
advice to his boy?” asked Baca. “‘My son,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
don’t steal cattle; but if you do steal cattle,
never give ’em up’! It is an admirable
maxim, and one which, in part, has been my
guide.”</p>

<p>“In part? Mr. Evers said in part: ‘My
dear Mister Umpire—my very dear sir—is
it not possible that you erred in your decision?’”
murmured Ducky with an air of
reminiscent abstraction.</p>

<p>“Drake!” said the lawyer, “whatever else
you may have to complain of at my hands,
you owe me your life—once and twice.”</p>

<p>“Am I to be both your prisoner and your
judge?” asked Ducky. “What inference am
I to draw?”</p>

<p>Baca snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>“My dear young friend, I do not care
that for your inference! Be well guided.
Leave Saragossa to-day and never come
back. The money for your cattle will be
forthcoming when you send a deed; get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
some lawyer or a bank to attend to the details
of exchange.”</p>

<p>“Oh! By the way, how about that mortgage
of mine?” inquired Neighbor.</p>

<p>“Pray accept my apologies, Mr. Jones. I
charged you with insolence: you are merely
impudent. You grow wearisome. Your caliber
is about twenty-two short, Jones!” said
Baca, tapping a monitory finger with a pencil.
“I am no man to get gay with. When
you measured your brains against mine you
flattered yourself considerably. I am not
to be bluffed. I am not to be forced. Judge
for yourself what chance you have of outwitting
me. And, as for the courts—‘Fo’
de land’s sake, Br’er Fox, whatever you
does—don’t t’row me in de brieh bush!’”</p>

<p>Neighbor blinked mildly.</p>

<p>“Oh, well! When two men play at one
game one of ’em has to lose!” he said philosophically.
“Never mind about the mortgage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
I’ve got no family anyway; so
where’s the diff? You win!”</p>

<p>“I win!” repeated the other. “And now
you will pay forfeit. Day before yesterday,
Mr. Jones, you drove a young man out of
town. You made him leave his suit
case——”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! I forgot that suit case. I
must get it.”</p>

<p>“You will not! And you took his gun.
That was an arbitrary act, Mr. Jones; and
now you are to receive fitting punishment
for it. The northbound accommodation
leaves here at eleven-forty. You will board
that train, accompanied by Mr. Drake and
escorted by myself. You will never come
back.”</p>

<p>“I hate to interrupt when you’re going so
good; but it’ll be better for all hands if
I declare myself now. You might propose
something I shouldn’t want to do,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
Neighbor Jones. “I’m holding no grudge
against you for outwitting me, and I’m willing
you should crow a little; but don’t rub
it in. I’m not the kind to be evened with
a tinhorn gambler. So I take that suit case
with me. I value it highly. It is a keepsake.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me; but I really do not see
where you are in any position to dictate
terms.”</p>

<p>“It is a remarkable fact,” said Neighbor
Jones with great composure, “that, in spite
of all the brag about the Southwest as a
health resort, the death rate here is precisely
the same as that of the crowded East
Side of the city of New York—namely, one
per capita. Such being the case, since I can
die but once and must die that once—I
should worry!—as we say in dear old Harvard.
Therefore, though you may do all
the dictating, I will make bold to mention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
the only terms that will be acceptable or accepted.
I have no fancy for humble pie—my
digestion ain’t good.”</p>

<p>“There is a certain force to your contention,
certainly,” conceded Baca, bending an
attentive regard on his opponent. “You put
it in a new light. Come, I must revise my
former estimate of you, I see. And then?”</p>

<p>“Then, this!”—Neighbor checked off the
counts with the thumb and fingers of his
left hand—“I am perfectly willing to leave
town and I never expect to come back—but
I won’t promise not to come back. Dicky
can have his trunk packed and sent after
him—leastly because he wouldn’t have time
to pack, and lastly because there was no
question of a threat about his baggage. Me,
I’ll take my duds.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure. And I’ll keep my gun. It’s
become a habit with me—that gun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>“We shall have to insist on the gun, I’m
afraid.”</p>

<p>“Baca,” said Neighbor severely, “do you
want me to nonplus you?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said Baca after consideration;
“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Be a little ware, then. Don’t bank too
much on your militia. Any insurance company
would rate you as a bad risk if they
suspected you of any designs on my gun.”</p>

<p>“Jones,” said Baca, “you please me.
Have it your own way. By all means march
out with the honors of war, side arms and
flags flying. Only you needn’t march—I’ll
take you down in the machine.”</p>

<p>Jones rose and looked at the clock.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go, then.... One thing
more: You send the money for the cattle
on to Albuquerque to-morrow, and we will
both pass our words that we’ll never, after
this day and hour, try to recover the Drake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
money from you or make any claim to it.
Yes, we will, Ducky. Do as I say and save
your cow money. You can’t collect a cent
from Bennett and Baca, and there’s no use
in trying.... All right—he’ll promise if
you will, Baca.”</p>

<p>“It’s a go!” said Baca.</p>

<p>“Shake, then!”</p>

<p>A big touring car purred at the door. At
Baca’s invitation Ducky drove, with Jones
beside him; while the bearded philosopher
sat with Baca in the tonneau. During the
exchange of views in the house the excitement
had kept Drake’s spirits up, but he
cooled down now, and showed some natural
depression, realizing the extent and hopelessness
of his loss. But Jones was in no
way abashed.</p>

<p>“I see the smoke. You’ll have to hurry,
if you want that suit case,” said Baca as
they drew up at Neighbor’s hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>“Oh, no—got her all packed; it won’t
take but a minute. Come along, if you’re
afraid I’ll give you the slip.”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” said Baca. “What good
would it do you?”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right,” grinned Jones.
“I’ve done my worst now.” He hurried in,
thrust a bill into the hotelkeeper’s hand and
grabbed up the suit case, now his own,
which had once belonged to the Kansas City
Kid. The car trundled them to the station
just in time to buy tickets.</p>

<p>“Well, good-by, Baca! Oh, say! Here’s
a V I borrowed from Beck. Wish you’d
give it to him as you go back uptown, and
tell him I’m much obliged. Give him my
best. He sleeps up over the joint, you
know.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll hand it to him. Hi!
You’re forgetting your suit case.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>“Oh, yes! Well, here she comes. So
long!”</p>

<p>“Glad to have met you. So long!”</p>

<p>There were no other passengers. The
little jerkwater train halted for a bare moment
to let them on and then chugged stolidly
on her way. They stood on the platform
of the rear car; the greenwood closed
in beside the right of way, so that the last
Ducky saw of Saragossa was the receding
triangle made by the station, the old Almandares
Warehouse, and a black doll waving
from a toy car. Ducky sighed.</p>

<p>“No hard feelings, kid?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Ducky stoutly.
“You’re not to blame. Besides, I don’t believe
we should ever have recovered that
money. That crowd got it, all right—I
know that anyway. I knew it before, but
I didn’t know that I knew it—wasn’t sure;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
not sure enough, for instance, to sanction
an attempt to take it by force.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Neighbor musingly. “I
thought of that. That’s why I took you up
to Baca’s place with me. I sure wasn’t expectin’
an ambush, though. Pretty smart
fellow, Baca!”</p>

<p>“Yes; and if we had tried force we might
jolly well have been killed,” said Drake
brightening.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s all turned out for the best,
Ducky. Well, let’s go in.”</p>

<p>“That’s a heavy bag you have there,”
said Ducky, lifting it.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Neighbor carelessly. “A
good share of it was gold.”</p>

<p>“A good share—<i>huh</i>? Whadda you
mean—gold?”</p>

<p>“Why, your uncle’s estate. It’s in there,
under my clothes. Beck had it in a new bag,
but I put it in mine when I counted it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>“<i>What!</i>”</p>

<p>“Don’t say what—say sir! Beck, he stole
it from his pals last night. They ain’t found
it out yet; but Tavy will be untyin’ Beck
about now.”</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>”</p>

<p>Ducky was on his knees, struggling with
the snaps of the suit case.</p>

<p>“Don’t spill any of it, Ducky. Yes; I
gagged Beck and hogtied him up in his own
poker room. Some job—believe me! I
put four aces in his vest pocket.”</p>
